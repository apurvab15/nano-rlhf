[V] I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
[V] Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
[V] And if it was an open-shut case
[V] I never would've known from that look on your face
[V] Lost in your current like a priceless wine
[C] The more that you say, the less I know
[C] Wherever you stray, I follow
[C] I'm begging for you to take my hand
[C] Wreck my plans, that's my man
[V] Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
[V] Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
[V] As if you were a mythical thing
[V] Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
[V] And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
[C] The more that you say, the less I know
[C] Wherever you stray, I follow
[C] I'm begging for you to take my hand
[C] Wreck my plans, that's my man
[C] You know that my train could take you home
[C] Anywhere else is hollow
[C] I'm begging for you to take my hand
[C] Wreck my plans, that's my man
[B] Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
[B] They count me out time and time again
[B] Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
[B] But I come back stronger than a '90s trend
[V] Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
[V] Show me the places where the others gave you scars
[V] Now this is an open-shut case
[V] I guess I should've known from the look on your face
[V] Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
[C] The more that you say, the less I know
[C] Wherever you stray, I follow
[C] I'm begging for you to take my hand
[C] Wreck my plans, that's my man
[C] You know that my train could take you home
[C] Anywhere else is hollow
[C] I'm begging for you to take my hand
[C] Wreck my plans, that's my man
[C] The more that you say, the less I know
[C] Wherever you stray, I follow
[C] I'm begging for you to take my hand
[C] Wreck my plans, that's my man
[C] You know that my train could take you home
[C] Anywhere else is hollow
[C] I'm begging for you to take my hand
[C] Wreck my plans, that's my man
[I] Hey, that's my man
[I] That's my man
[I] Yeah, that's my man
[I] Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
[I] That's my man
[I] Hey, that's my man
[I] I'm begging for you to take my hand
[I] Wreck my plans, that's my man

[V] You booked the night train for a reason
[V] So you could sit there in this hurt
[V] Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
[V] You're not sure which is worse
[C] Because I dropped your hand while dancing
[C] Left you out there standing
[C] Crestfallen on the landing
[C] Champagne problems
[C] Your mom's ring in your pocket
[C] My picture in your wallet
[C] Your heart was glass, I dropped it
[C] Champagne problems
[V] You told your family for a reason
[V] You couldn't keep it in
[V] Your sister splashed out on the bottle
[V] Now no one's celebrating
[C] Dom-Pérignon, you brought it
[C] No crowd of friends applauded
[C] Your hometown skeptics called it
[C] Champagne problems
[C] You had a speech, you're speechless
[C] Love slipped beyond your reaches
[C] And I couldn't give a reason
[C] Champagne problems
[B] Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
[B] November flush and your flannel cure
[B] "This dorm was once a madhouse"
[B] I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
[B] How evergreen, our group of friends
[B] Don't think we'll say that word again
[B] And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
[B] That we once walked through
[B] One for the money, two for the show
[B] I never was ready so I watch you go
[B] Sometimes you just don't know the answer
[B] 'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
[B] "She would've made such a lovely bride
[B] What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
[B] But you'll find the real thing instead
[B] She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred
[C] And hold your hand while dancing
[C] Never leave you standing
[C] Crestfallen on the landing
[C] With champagne problems
[C] Your mom's ring in your pocket
[C] Her picture in your wallet
[C] You won't remember all my
[C] Champagne problems
[I] You won't remember all my
[I] Champagne problems

[I] Gleaming, twinkling
[I] Eyes like sinking
[I] Ships on waters
[I] So inviting, I almost jump in
[C] But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
[C] I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
[C] I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
[C] Everybody wants you
[C] Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
[C] Walk past, quick brush
[C] I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
[C] I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
[C] Everybody wants you
[C] But I don't like a gold rush
[V] What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
[V] With your hair falling into place like dominoes
[V] I see me padding across your wooden floors
[V] With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door
[R] At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian shit
[R] And the coastal town we wandered 'round had never seen a love as pure as it
[R] And then it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
[R] 'Cause it could never be
[C] 'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
[C] I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
[C] I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
[C] Everybody wants you
[C] Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
[C] Walk past, quick brush
[C] I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
[C] I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
[C] Everybody wants you
[C] But I don't like a gold rush
[V] What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
[V] With your hair falling into place like dominoes
[V] My mind turns your life into folklore
[V] I can't dare to dream about you anymore
[R] At dinner parties, I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
[R] And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
[R] 'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
[R] 'Cause it will never be
[I] Gleaming, twinkling
[I] Eyes like sinking
[I] Ships on waters
[I] So inviting, I almost jump in

[V] If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
[V] While I was gone, I would've asked you
[V] It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
[V] But I felt it when I passed you
[V] There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
[V] But if it's all the same to you
[V] It's the same to me
[C] So we could call it even
[C] You could call me "babe" for the weekend
[C] 'Tis the damn season, write this down
[C] I'm stayin' at my parents' house
[C] And the road not taken looks real good now
[C] And it always leads to you and my hometown
[V] I parked my car right between the Methodist
[V] And the school that used to be ours
[V] The holidays linger like bad perfume
[V] You can run, but only so far
[V] I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
[V] But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me
[C] We could call it even
[C] You could call me "babe" for the weekend
[C] 'Tis the damn season, write this down
[C] I'm stayin' at my parents' house
[C] And the road not taken looks real good now
[C] Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
[C] Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
[C] We could just ride around
[C] And the road not taken looks real good now
[C] And it always leads to you and my hometown
[B] Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
[B] I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
[B] So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
[B] Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
[B] And wonder about the only soul
[B] Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
[B] And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
[B] To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
[B] We could call it even
[B] Even though I'm leaving
[B] And I'll be yours for the weekend
[B] 'Tis the damn season
[C] We could call it even
[C] You could call me "babe" for the weekend
[C] 'Tis the damn season, write this down
[C] I'm stayin' at my parents' house

[C] We could just ride around
[C] And the road not taken looks real good now
[C] And it always leads to you and my hometown
[I] It always leads to you and my hometown

[V] I sit and watch you readin' with your head low
[V] I wake and watch you breathin' with your eyes closed
[V] I sit and watch you
[V] I notice everything you do or don't do
[V] You're so much older and wiser, and I
[C] I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
[C] Use my best colors for your portrait
[C] Lay the table with the fancy shit
[C] And watch you tolerate it
[C] If it's all in my head, tell me now
[C] Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
[C] I know my love should be celebrated
[C] But you tolerate it
[V] I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
[V] I take your indiscretions all in good fun
[V] I sit and listen
[V] I polish plates until they gleam and glisten
[V] You're so much older and wiser, and I
[C] I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
[C] Use my best colors for your portrait
[C] Lay the table with the fancy shit

[C] Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
[C] I know my love should be celebrated
[C] But you tolerate it
[B] While you were out buildin' other worlds, where was I?
[B] Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
[B] I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
[B] Now I'm beggin' for footnotes in the story of your life
[B] Drawin' hearts in the byline
[B] Always takin' up too much space or time
[B] You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I (I)
[C] Break free and leave us in ruins?
[C] Took this dagger in me and removed it
[C] Gain the weight of you, then lose it
[C] Believe me, I could do it
[C] If it's all in my head, tell me now
[C] Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
[C] I know my love should be celebrated
[C] But you tolerate it
[I] I sit and watch you

[I] He did it
[I] He did it
[V] Este's a friend of mine
[V] We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
[V] Este's been losin' sleep
[V] Her husband's actin' different and it smells like infidelity
[V] She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
[V] That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
[V] No, there ain't no doubt
[V] I think I'm gonna call him out

[C] I think he did it, but I just can't prove it

[C] But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die
[C] No, no
[C] I think he did it
[C] No, no
[C] He did it
[V] Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive-Garden
[V] At her job or anywhere
[V] He reports his missing wife
[V] And I noticed when I passed his house
[V] His truck has got some brand new tires
[V] And his mistress moved in
[V] Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
[V] No, there ain't no doubt
[V] Somebody's gotta catch him out 'cause
[C] I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
[C] I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)

[C] No, no
[C] He did it
[B] Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
[B] And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
[B] Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me (She was with me, dude)
[B] Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
[C] They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
[C] They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
[C] She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it
[I] No, no body, no crime

[V] Honey, when I'm above the trees
[V] I see this for what it is
[V] But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
[V] Is just shit we're dividin' up
[V] Showed you all of my hiding spots
[V] I was dancing when the music stopped
[V] And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
[V] I haven't met the new me yet
[C] There'll be happiness after you
[C] But there was happiness because of you
[C] Both of these things can be true
[C] There is happiness
[C] Past the blood and bruise
[C] Past the curses and cries
[C] Beyond the terror in the nightfall
[C] Haunted by the look in my eyes
[C] That would've loved you for a lifetime
[C] Leave it all behind
[C] And there is happiness
[V] Tell me, when did your winning smile
[V] Begin to look like a smirk?
[V] When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
[V] Pointed at my deepest hurt?
[V] I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
[V] Who takes my spot next to you
[V] No, I didn't mean that
[V] Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
[V] You haven't met the new me yet
[C] There'll be happiness after me
[C] But there was happiness because of me
[C] Both of these things, I believe
[C] There is happiness
[C] In our history, across our great divide
[C] There is a glorious sunrise
[C] Dappled with the flickers of light
[C] From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
[C] And there is happiness
[B] I can't make it go away by making you a villain
[B] I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
[B] And I pulled your body into mine
[B] Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
[B] No one teaches you what to do
[B] When a good man hurts you
[B] And you know you hurt him too
[V] Honey, when I'm above the trees
[V] I see it for what it is
[V] But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
[V] After giving you the best I had
[V] Tell me what to give after that
[V] All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
[V] You haven't met the new me yet
[V] And I think she'll give you that
[C] There'll be happiness after you
[C] But there was happiness because of you too
[C] Both of these things can be true
[C] There is happiness
[C] In our history, across our great divide
[C] There is a glorious sunrise
[C] Dappled with the flickers of light
[C] From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
[C] Oh, leave it all behind
[C] Leave it all behind
[C] And there is happiness

[V] Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
[V] When we were younger, down in the park
[V] Honey, makin' a lark of the misery
[V] You got shiny friends since you left town
[V] A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
[V] And I got nothin' but well wishes for ya
[C] Ooh
[C] This place is the same as it ever was
[C] Ooh
[C] But you won't like it that way
[C] It's never too late to come back to my side
[C] The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
[C] And if you're ever tired of bein' known for who you know
[C] You know that you'll always know me
[C] Dorothea, uh-uh
[C] Dorothea, ah-ah
[C] Ooh
[C] You're a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines
[C] Ooh
[C] From you, I'd buy anything
[V] Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
[V] When it was calmer, skippin' the prom
[V] Just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes
[V] And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
[V] But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well
[C] Ooh
[C] I guess I'll never know
[C] Ooh
[C] And you'll go on with the show
[C] But it's never too late to come back to my side
[C] The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo
[C] And if you're ever tired of bein' known for who you know
[C] You know, you'll always know me
[C] Dorothea, uh-uh
[C] Dorothea, ah-ah
[I] Ooh, ooh
[I] Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[I] Ooh, ooh
[I] Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
[I] Dorothea (Ah-ah-ah)
[I] Ah-ah
[I] Ooh

[V] Break my soul in two looking for you
[V] But you're right here
[V] If I can't relate to you anymore
[V] Then who am I related to?
[V] And if this is the long haul
[V] How'd we get here so soon?
[V] Did I close my fist around something delicate?
[V] Did I shatter you?
[C] And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney-Island
[C] Wondering, where did my baby go?
[C] The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
[C] Sorry for not making you my centerfold
[C] Over and over
[C] Lost again with no surprises
[C] Disappointments, close your eyes
[C] And it gets colder and colder
[C] When the sun goes down
[V] The question pounds my head
[V] What's a lifetime of achievement
[V] If I pushed you to the edge
[V] But you were too polite to leave me?
[V] And do you miss the rogue
[V] Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
[V] Will you forgive my soul
[V] When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
[C] 'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
[C] It was the one place to be
[C] The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
[C] Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
[C] Over and over
[C] Lost again with no surprises
[C] Disappointments, close your eyes
[C] And it gets colder and colder
[C] When the sun goes down
[B] Were you waiting at our old spot
[B] In the tree line by the gold clock
[B] Did I leave you hanging every single day?
[B] Were you standing in the hallway
[B] With a big cake, happy birthday
[B] Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
[B] A universe away
[B] And when I got into the accident
[B] The sight that flashed before me was your face
[B] But when I walked up to the podium
[B] I think that I forgot to say your name
[C] I'm on a bench in Coney-Island
[C] Wondering, where did my baby go?
[C] The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
[C] Sorry for not making you my centerfold
[C] Over and over
[C] Lost again with no surprises
[C] Disappointments, close your eyes
[C] And it gets colder and colder
[C] When the sun goes down
[I] When the sun goes down
[I] The sight that flashed before me was your face
[I] When the sun goes down
[I] But I think that I forgot to say your name
[I] Over and over
[I] Sorry for not making you my, making you my
[I] Making you my centerfold

[V] How's one to know?
[V] I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
[V] In a faith-forgotten land
[V] In from the snow
[V] Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
[V] Tarnished but so grand
[C] And the old widow goes to the stone every day
[C] But I don't, I just sit here and wait
[C] Grieving for the living
[C] Oh, goddamn
[C] My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
[C] Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
[C] Oh, I can't
[C] Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
[C] My house of stone, your ivy grows
[C] And now I'm covered in you
[V] I wish to know
[V] The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
[V] Magnificently cursed
[V] He's in the room
[V] Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
[V] He wants what's only yours
[C] Oh, goddamn
[C] My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
[C] Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
[C] Oh, I can't
[C] Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
[C] My house of stone, your ivy grows
[C] And now I'm covered
[V] Clover blooms in the fields
[V] Spring breaks loose, the time is near
[V] What would he do if he found us out?
[V] Crescent moon, coast is clear
[V] Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
[V] He's gonna burn this house to the ground
[V] How's one to know?
[V] I'd live and die for moments that we stole
[V] On begged and borrowed time
[V] So tell me to run
[V] Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
[V] And drink my husband's wine
[C] Oh, goddamn
[C] My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
[C] Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
[C] Oh, I can't
[C] Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
[C] My house of stone, your ivy grows
[C] And now I'm covered in you
[C] And I'm covered in you
[B] So yeah, it's a fire
[B] It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
[B] And you started it
[B] You started it
[B] So yeah, it's a war
[B] It's the goddamn fight of my life
[B] And you started it
[B] You started it
[C] Oh, I can't
[C] Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
[C] My house of stone, your ivy grows
[C] And now I'm covered
[C] In you, in you
[C] Now I'm covered in you
[C] In you

[V] And the tennis court was covered up
[V] With some tent-like thing
[V] And you asked me to dance
[V] But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game"
[V] Oh, I thought
[V] This is gonna be one of those things
[V] Now I know
[V] I'm never gonna love again
[R] I've got some tricks up my sleeve
[R] Takes one to know one
[R] You're a cowboy like me
[V] Never wanted love
[V] Just a fancy car
[V] Now I'm waiting by the phone
[V] Like I'm sitting in an airport bar
[R] You had some tricks up your sleeve
[R] Takes one to know one
[R] You're a cowboy like me
[C] Perched in the dark
[C] Tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
[C] Like it could be love
[C] I could be the way forward
[C] Only if they pay for it
[C] You're a bandit like me
[C] Eyes full of stars
[C] Hustling for the good life, never thought I'd meet you here
[C] It could be love
[C] We could be the way forward
[C] And I know I'll pay for it
[C] You're a cowboy like me

[C] It could be love
[C] We could be the way forward
[C] And I know I'll pay for it
[B] And the skeletons in both our closets
[B] Plotted hard to fuck this up
[B] And the old men that I've swindled
[B] Really did believe I was the one
[B] And the ladies lunchin' have their stories about
[B] When you passed through town
[B] Oh, but that was all before I locked it down
[V] Now you hang from my lips
[V] Like the Gardens-of-Babylon
[V] With your boots beneath my bed
[V] Forever is the sweetest con
[R] I've had some tricks up my sleeve
[R] Takes one to know one
[R] You're a cowboy like me
[I] And I'm never gonna love again
[I] I'm never gonna love again
[I] I'm never gonna love again

[V] Fatefully
[V] I tried to pick my battles 'til the battle picked me
[V] Misery
[V] Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
[V] And you passed right by
[V] I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
[V] The knife cuts both ways
[V] If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break
[C] And I fell from the pedestal
[C] Right down the rabbit hole
[C] Long story short, it was a bad time
[C] Pushed from the precipice
[C] Clung to the nearest lips
[C] Long story short, it was the wrong guy
[C] Now I'm all about you
[C] I'm all about you, ah
[C] Yeah, yeah
[C] I'm all about you, ah
[C] Yeah, yeah
[V] Actually
[V] I always felt I must look better in the rear view
[V] Missing me
[V] At the golden gates they once held the keys to
[V] When I dropped my sword
[V] I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
[V] And we live in peace
[V] But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready
[C] 'Cause I fell from the pedestal
[C] Right down the rabbit hole
[C] Long story short, it was a bad time
[C] Pushed from the precipice
[C] Clung to the nearest lips
[C] Long story short, it was the wrong guy
[C] Now I'm all about you
[C] I'm all about you, ah
[C] Yeah, yeah
[C] I'm all about you
[B] No more keepin' score
[B] Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
[B] No more tug of war
[B] Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
[B] No more keepin' score
[B] Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
[B] And my waves meet your shore
[B] Ever and evermore
[V] Past me
[V] I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
[V] Your nemeses
[V] Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
[V] And he's passing by
[V] Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
[V] And he feels like home
[V] If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go
[C] And I fell from the pedestal
[C] Right down the rabbit hole
[C] Long story short, it was a bad time
[C] Pushed from the precipice
[C] Climbed right back up the cliff
[C] Long story short, I survived
[C] Now I'm all about you
[C] (And now) I'm all about you, ah
[C] (And now) I'm all about you
[C] (And now) I'm all about you, ah
[C] Yeah, yeah
[C] I'm all about you
[C] (And now) Yeah, yeah
[C] I'm all about you
[I] Long story short, it was a bad time
[I] Long story short, I survived

[V] Never be so kind
[V] You forget to be clever
[V] Never be so clever
[V] You forget to be kind
[C] And if I didn't know better
[C] I'd think you were talking to me now
[C] If I didn't know better
[C] I'd think you were still around
[C] What died didn't stay dead
[C] What died didn't stay dead
[C] You're alive, you're alive in my head
[C] What died didn't stay dead

[C] What died didn't stay dead
[C] What died didn't stay dead
[C] You're alive, so alive
[B] The autumn chill that wakes me up
[B] You loved the amber skies so much
[B] Long limbs and frozen swims
[B] You'd always go past where our feet could touch
[B] And I complained the whole way there
[B] The car ride back and up the stairs
[B] I should've asked you questions
[B] I should've asked you how to be
[B] Asked you to write it down for me
[B] Should've kept every grocery store receipt
[B] 'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
[B] Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
[B] All your closets of backlogged dreams
[B] And how you left them all to me
[C] What died didn't stay dead

[I] I'd think you were singing to me now
[I] If I didn't know better
[I] I'd think you were still around
[I] I know better
[I] But I still feel you all around
[I] I know better
[I] But you're still around

[V] It's been a long time
[V] And seeing the shape of your name
[V] Still spells out pain
[V] It wasn't right
[V] The way it all went down
[V] Looks like you know that now
[C] Yes, I got your letter
[C] Yes, I'm doing better
[C] It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
[C] Yes, I got your letter
[C] Yes, I'm doing better
[C] I know that it's over, I don't need your
[C] Closure, your closure
[V] Don't treat me like
[V] Some situation that needs to be handled
[V] I'm fine with my spite
[V] And my tears and my beers and my candles
[V] I can feel you smoothing me over
[C] Yes, I got your letter
[C] Yes, I'm doing better

[C] I know that it's over, I don't need your
[C] Closure, your closure
[C] Your closure, your closure
[B] I know I'm just a wrinkle in your new life
[B] Staying friends would iron it out so nice
[B] Guilty, guilty, reaching out across the sea
[B] That you put between you and me
[B] But it's fake and it's oh-so unnecessary
[C] Yes, I got your letter
[C] Yes, I'm doing better
[C] It cut deep to know ya, right to the bone
[C] Yes, I got your letter
[C] Yes, I'm doing better
[C] I know that it's over, I don't need your
[C] Closure, closure, your closure
[C] Your closure

[V] Gray November
[V] I've been down since July
[V] Motion capture
[V] Put me in a bad light
[V] I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
[V] Trying to find the one where I went wrong
[V] Writing letters
[V] Addressed to the fire
[C] And I was catchin' my breath
[C] Starin' out an open window, catchin' my death
[C] And I couldn't be sure
[C] I had a feeling so peculiar
[C] That this pain would be for
[C] Evermore
[V] Hey, December
[V] Guess I'm feeling unmoored
[V] Can't remember
[V] What I used to fight for
[V] I rewind the tape, but all it does is pause
[V] On the very moment all was lost
[V] Sending signals
[V] To be double-crossed
[C] And I was catchin' my breath
[C] Barefoot in the wildest winter, catchin' my death
[C] And I couldn't be sure
[C] I had a feeling so peculiar
[C] That this pain would be for
[C] Evermore
[C] (Evermore)
[B] Can't not think of all the cost
[B] And the things that will be lost
[B] Oh, can we just get a pause?
[B] To be certain we'll be tall again
[B] Whether weather be the frost
[B] Or the violence of the dog days
[B] I'm on waves, out being tossed
[B] Is there a line that I could just go cross?
[B] And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost now)
[B] I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
[B] In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
[B] I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again)
[B] (If you think of all the cost)
[B] It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
[B] To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
[B] (Or the violence of the dog days)
[B] (Out on waves, being tossed)
[B] (I'm on waves, out being tossed)
[B] But I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
[B] You were there
[C] And I was catchin' my breath
[C] Floors of a cabin creakin' under my step
[C] And I couldn't be sure
[C] I had a feeling so peculiar
[C] This pain wouldn't be for
[C] Evermore
[I] Evermore (Evermore)
[I] Evermore (Evermore)
[I] This pain wouldn't be for evermore
[I] Evermore

[V] Friends break up, friends get married
[V] Strangers get born, strangers get buried
[V] Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
[V] But I'm right where you left me
[V] Matches burn after the other
[V] Pages turn and stick to each other
[V] Wages earned and lessons learned
[V] But I, I'm right where you left me
[C] Help, I'm still at the restaurant
[C] Still sitting in a corner I haunt
[C] Cross-legged in the dim light
[C] They say, "What a sad sight," I
[C] I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
[C] Right when I felt the moment stop
[C] Glass shattered on the white cloth
[C] Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
[C] Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
[C] They expected me to find somewhere
[C] Some perspective, but I sat and stared right where
[C] You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
[C] You left me no choice but to stay here forever
[C] You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
[C] You left me no choice but to stay here forever
[B] Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
[B] Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
[B] She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
[B] How it was supposed to be
[B] Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
[B] Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
[B] She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
[B] And you're sitting in front of me
[C] At the restaurant
[C] When I was still the one you want
[C] Cross-legged in the dim light
[C] Everything was just right, I
[C] I could feel the mascara run
[C] You told me that you met someone
[C] Glass shattered on the white cloth
[C] Everybody moved on
[C] Help, I'm still at the restaurant
[C] Still sitting in a corner I haunt
[C] Cross-legged in the dim light
[C] They say, "What a sad sight," I, I stayed there
[C] Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
[C] I'm sure that you got a wife out there
[C] Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware 'cause I'm right where
[C] I cause no harm, mind my business
[C] If our love died young, I can't bear witness, and it's been so long
[C] If you ever think you got it wrong, I'm right where
[C] You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
[C] You left me no choice but to stay here forever
[C] You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
[C] You left me no choice but to stay here forever

[V] When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
[V] You ask for the tab
[V] Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
[V] Look at each other like that
[V] When the words of a sister come back in whispers
[V] That prove she was not
[V] In fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams
[V] She's a crook who was caught
[C] That old familiar body ache
[C] The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
[C] You know when it's time to go
[V] Twenty years at your job, then the son of the boss
[V] Gets the spot that was yours
[V] Or trying to stay for the kids, when keeping it how it is
[V] Will only break their hearts worse
[C] That old familiar body ache
[C] The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
[C] You know when it's time to go
[C] Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
[C] Sometimes, to run is the brave thing
[C] Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
[C] That will find you the right thing
[C] Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
[C] Sometimes, to run is the brave thing
[C] Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
[C] That will find you the right thing
[V] Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
[V] Begging 'til my knees bled
[V] I gave it my all, he gave me nothin' at all
[V] Then wondered why I left
[V] Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
[V] Praying to his greed
[V] He's got my past frozen behind glass
[V] But I've got me
[C] That old familiar body ache
[C] The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
[C] I know when it's time to go
[C] Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
[C] Sometimes, to run is the brave thing
[C] Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
[C] That will find you the right thing
[C] Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
[C] Sometimes, to run is the brave thing
[C] Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
[C] That will find you the right thing
[I] That will find you the right thing
[I] And you know in your soul
[I] And you know in your soul
[I] When it's time to go
[I] And, well, you know, you know, you know, you know
[I] When it's time to go
[I] So then you go and then you go
[I] You just go

[V] There's somethin' 'bout the way
[V] The street looks when it's just rained
[V] There's a glow off the pavement
[V] You walk me to the car
[V] And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
[V] In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah
[V] Oh, yeah
[V] We're driving down the road
[V] I wonder if you know
[V] I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
[V] But you're just so cool
[V] Run your hands through your hair
[V] Absent-mindedly makin' me want you
[C] And I don't know how it gets better than this
[C] You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
[C] And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
[C] In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
[V] So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
[V] In this one-horse town, I wanna stay right here
[V] In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
[V] In this moment now, capture it, remember it
[C] 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
[C] You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
[C] And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
[C] In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
[C] Oh-oh
[B] Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
[B] My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
[B] But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
[B] It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
[B] It's fearless
[B] Oh, yeah
[C] 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
[C] You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
[C] And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
[C] In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
[C] 'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
[C] You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
[C] And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
[C] In a storm, in my best dress, fearless
[I] Oh-oh
[I] Oh-oh, yeah

[V] You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
[V] It's the mornin' of your very first day
[V] You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
[V] Try and stay out of everybody's way
[V] It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
[V] For the next four years in this town
[V] Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
[V] "You know, I haven't seen you around before"
[C] 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
[C] You're gonna believe them
[C] And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
[C] Well, count to ten, take it in
[C] This is life before you know who you're gonna be
[C] At fifteen
[V] You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
[V] And soon enough, you're best friends
[V] Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
[V] We'll be outta here as soon as we can
[V] And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
[V] And you're feelin' like flyin'
[V] And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
[V] And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
[V] When the night ends
[C] 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
[C] You're gonna believe them
[C] And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
[C] Makes your head spin around, well
[C] In your life you'll do things greater than
[C] Datin' the boy on the football team
[C] I didn't know it at fifteen
[B] When all you wanted was to be wanted
[B] Wish you could go back
[B] And tell yourself what you know now
[V] Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
[V] But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
[V] And Abigail gave everything she had
[V] To a boy who changed his mind
[V] And we both cried
[C] 'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
[C] You're gonna believe them
[C] And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
[C] But I've found time can heal most anything
[C] And you just might find who you're supposed to be
[C] I didn't know who I was supposed to be
[C] At fifteen
[C] La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
[C] La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
[C] La-la-la, la-la-la
[I] Your very first day
[I] Take a deep breath, girl
[I] Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors

[V] We were both young when I first saw you
[V] I close my eyes and the flashback starts
[V] I'm standing there
[V] On a balcony in summer air
[V] See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
[V] See you make your way through the crowd
[V] And say, "Hello"
[V] Little did I know
[C] That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
[C] And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
[C] And I was crying on the staircase
[C] Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
[C] Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
[C] I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
[C] You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[C] It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
[V] So I sneak out to the garden to see you
[V] We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
[V] So close your eyes
[V] Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
[C] 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
[C] And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
[C] But you were everything to me
[C] I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
[C] Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
[C] I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
[C] You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[C] It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
[C] Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
[C] This love is difficult, but it's real
[C] Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
[C] It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
[C] Oh, oh
[B] But I got tired of waiting
[B] Wondering if you were ever coming around
[B] My faith in you was fading
[B] When I met you on the outskirts of town
[C] And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
[C] I keep waiting for you, but you never come
[C] Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
[C] He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
[C] "Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
[C] I love you and that's all I really know
[C] I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
[C] It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"
[I] Oh, oh, oh
[I] Oh, oh, oh
[I] 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

[I] Mmm, mmm
[I] Mmm, mmm
[I] Mmm, yeah
[V] Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceivin'
[V] But I know I saw a light in you
[V] And as we walked, we were talkin'
[V] I didn't say half the things I wanted to
[V] Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
[V] I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
[V] Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believin'
[V] I don't always have to be alone
[C] 'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
[C] Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
[C] Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
[C] Can't help it if there's no one else
[C] Mmm, I can't help myself
[C] Mm, mmm
[C] Oh-woah, mmm
[V] Hey Stephen, I've been holdin' back this feelin'
[V] So I've got some things to say to you, huh
[V] I've seen it all, so I thought
[V] But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
[V] The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
[V] It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
[V] Hey Stephen, why are people always leavin'?
[V] I think you and I should stay the same
[C] 'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
[C] Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
[C] Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
[C] Can't help it if there's no one else
[C] Mmm, I can't help myself
[C] Mmm, mmm
[B] They're dimming the street lights
[B] You're perfect for me
[B] Why aren't you here tonight?
[B] I'm waitin' alone now
[B] So come on and come out
[B] And pull me near
[B] And shine, shine, shine
[V] Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
[V] Why I should be the one you choose
[V] All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
[V] But would they write a song for you? ha-ha
[C] I can't help it if you look like an angel
[C] Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
[C] Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
[C] Can't help it if there's no one else
[C] Mmm, I can't help myself
[C] If you look like an angel
[C] Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so
[C] Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
[C] Can't help it if there's no one else
[C] Mmm, I can't help myself
[I] Oh-oh, myself
[I] Mmm, I can't help myself
[I] I can't help myself, oh-oh-oh
[I] Mmm, mmm
[I] Mmm, mmm, mmm

[V] Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
[V] Comes out just when you need it to
[V] As I paced back and forth all this time
[V] 'Cause I honestly believed in you
[C] Holdin' on, the days drag on
[C] Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
[C] That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
[C] I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
[C] This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
[C] I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
[C] Now it's too late for you and your white horse
[C] To come around
[V] Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
[V] And never really had a chance
[V] Well, my mistake, I didn't know to be in love
[V] You had to fight to have the upper hand
[C] I had so many dreams about you and me
[C] Happy endings, well now I know
[C] That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
[C] I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
[C] This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
[C] I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
[C] Now it's too late for you and your white horse
[C] To come around
[B] And there you are on your knees
[B] Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
[B] Just like I always wanted
[B] But I'm so sorry
[C] 'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
[C] I'm gonna find someone someday
[C] Who might actually treat me well
[C] This is a big world, that was a small town
[C] There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
[C] And it's too late for you and your white horse
[C] Now it's too late for you and your white horse
[C] To catch me now
[I] Oh, woah, woah, woah
[I] Try and catch me now, oh
[I] It's too late to catch me now

[V] You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
[V] She's goin' off about something that you said
[V] 'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
[V] I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
[V] I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
[V] And she'll never know your story like I do
[C] 'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
[C] She's Cheer-Captain and I'm on the bleachers
[C] Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
[C] That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time
[C] If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
[C] Been here all along, so why can't you see?
[C] You belong with me, you belong with me
[V] Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
[V] I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
[V] Laughin' on a park bench, thinking to myself
[V] "Hey, isn't this easy?"
[V] And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
[V] I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
[V] You say you're fine, I know you better than that
[V] Hey, what you doin' with a girl like that?
[C] She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
[C] She's Cheer-Captain and I'm on the bleachers
[C] Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
[C] That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time
[C] If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
[C] Been here all along, so why can't you see?
[C] You belong with me
[C] Standin' by and waitin' at your back door
[C] All this time, how could you not know, baby?
[C] You belong with me, you belong with me
[B] Oh, I remember you
[B] Driving to my house in the middle of the night
[B] I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry
[B] I know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams
[B] Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me
[C] Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
[C] Been here all along, so why can't you see? (Ah)
[C] You belong with me
[C] Standin' by and waitin' at your back door
[C] All this time, how could you not know, baby?
[C] You belong with me, you belong with me
[I] You belong with me
[I] Have you ever thought, just maybe you belong with me?
[I] You belong with me

[V] I see your face in my mind as I drive away
[V] 'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
[V] People are people and sometimes we change our minds
[V] But it's killin' me to see you go after all this time
[B] Mm, mmm
[B] Mm, mmm
[V] The music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
[V] It's the kind of endin' you don't really wanna see
[V] 'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
[V] Now I don't know what to be without you around
[C] And we know it's never simple, never easy
[C] Never a clean break, no one here to save me
[C] You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
[C] And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
[C] Breathe without you, but I have to
[V] Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
[V] Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
[V] But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
[V] And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout
[C] And we know it's never simple, never easy
[C] Never a clean break, no one here to save me
[C] You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
[C] And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
[C] Breathe without you, but I have to
[B] It's 2AM, feelin' like I just lost a friend
[B] Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
[B] It's 2AM, feelin' like I just lost a friend
[B] Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
[C] And we know it's never simple, never easy
[C] Never a clean break, no one here to save me
[C] Woah
[C] I can't breathe without you, but I have to
[C] Breathe without you, but I have to
[C] Breathe without you, but I have to
[I] I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm), I'm sorry (Yeah, yeah), I'm sorry
[I] I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh), I'm sorry

[V] I took a chance, I took a shot
[V] And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
[V] You took a swing, I took it hard
[V] And down here from the ground, I see who you are
[C] I'm sick and tired of your attitude
[C] I'm feelin' like I don't know you
[C] You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
[C] And I need you like a heartbeat
[C] But you know you got a mean streak
[C] Makes me run for cover when you're around
[C] Here's to you and your temper
[C] Yes, I remember what you said last night
[C] And I know that you see what you're doing to me
[C] Tell me why
[V] Well, you could write a book on
[V] How to ruin someone's perfect day
[V] Well, I get so confused and frustrated
[V] Forget what I'm trying to say, oh-oh
[C] I'm sick and tired of your reasons
[C] I got no one to believe in
[C] You tell me that you want me, then push me around
[C] And I need you like a heartbeat
[C] But you know you got a mean streak
[C] Makes me run for cover when you're around
[C] Here's to you and your temper
[C] Yes, I remember what you said last night
[C] And I know that you see what you're doing to me
[C] Tell me why
[B] Why do you have to make me feel small
[B] So you can feel whole inside?
[B] Why do you have to put down my dreams
[B] So you're the only thing on my mind?
[C] Well, I'm sick and tired of your attitude
[C] Feelin' like I don't know you
[C] You tell me that you want me and cut me down
[C] I'm sick and tired of your reasons
[C] I've got no one to believe in
[C] You ask me for my love, then you push me around
[C] Here's to you and your temper
[C] Yes, I remember what you said last night
[C] And I know that you see what you're doing to me
[C] Tell me why
[C] Why
[C] Tell me why, oh
[I] I take a step back, I let you go
[I] I told you I'm not bulletproof, now you know

[V] All this time, I was wastin', hopin' you would come around
[V] I've been givin' out chances every time and all you do is let me down
[V] And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
[V] And you're thinkin' we'll be fine again, but not this time around
[C] You don't have to call anymore
[C] I won't pick up the phone
[C] This is the last straw
[C] Don't wanna hurt anymore
[C] And you can tell me that you're sorry
[C] But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
[C] You're not sorry
[C] No, no, no, no
[V] You're lookin' so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
[V] Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waitin' in the cold
[V] And you've got your share of secrets and I'm tired of bein' last to know, oh
[V] And now you're askin' me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before
[C] But you don't have to call anymore
[C] I won't pick up the phone
[C] This is the last straw
[C] Don't wanna hurt anymore
[C] And you can tell me that you're sorry
[C] But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before

[B] You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade
[C] So you don't have to call anymore
[C] I won't pick up the phone
[C] This is the last straw
[C] There's nothin' left to beg for
[C] And you can tell me that you're sorry
[C] But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
[C] You're not sorry
[C] No, no
[C] You're not sorry

[V] He is sensible and so incredible
[V] And all my single friends are jealous
[V] He says everything I need to hear
[V] And it's like I couldn't ask for anything better
[C] He opens up my door and I get into his car
[C] And he says, "You look beautiful tonight"
[C] And I feel perfectly fine
[C] But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain
[C] And it's 2AM and I'm cursin' your name
[C] So in love that you act insane
[C] And that's the way I loved you
[C] Breakin' down and comin' undone
[C] It's a, a rollercoaster kind of rush

[V] He respects my space
[V] And never makes me wait
[V] And he calls exactly when he says he will
[V] He's close to my mother
[V] Talks business with my father
[V] He's charming and endearing
[V] And I'm comfortable
[C] But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain

[V] Once upon a time
[V] I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
[V] And we caught onto somethin'
[V] I hold onto the night
[V] You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
[V] Were you just kiddin'?
[V] 'Cause it seems to me
[V] This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
[V] I don't feel welcome anymore
[V] Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
[V] 'Cause, one second, it was perfect
[V] Now you're halfway out the door
[C] And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
[C] And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
[C] And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always," oh
[C] Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
[C] It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
[C] 'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
[V] Was I out of line?
[V] Did I say somethin' way too honest, made you run and hide
[V] Like a scared little boy?
[V] I looked into your eyes
[V] Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
[V] So here's to everything coming down to nothin'
[V] Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
[V] Where is this going?
[V] Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
[C] And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
[C] And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
[C] And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always," oh
[C] Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
[C] It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
[C] 'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
[C] You didn't mean it, baby
[C] I don't think so
[C] Oh, woah
[B] Oh, back up, baby, back up
[B] Did you forget everything?
[B] Back up, baby, back up
[B] Did you forget everything?
[C] 'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
[C] It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
[C] 'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
[C] Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
[C] And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all
[C] And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
[C] And it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
[C] It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
[C] 'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
[I] You didn't mean it, baby
[I] You said, "Forever and always," yeah

[V] I'm five years old, it's gettin' cold, I've got my big coat on
[V] I hear your laugh and look up smilin' at you, I run and run
[V] Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides, look, now the sky is gold
[V] I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
[C] I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
[C] But I know you're not scared of anything at all
[C] Don't know if Snow-White's house is near or far away
[C] But I know I had the best day with you today
[V] I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean
[V] I come home cryin' and you hold me tight and grab the keys
[V] And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
[V] And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
[C] I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school
[C] But I know I'm laughin' on the car ride home with you
[C] Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
[C] But I know I had the best day with you today
[B] I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
[B] god smiles on my little brother, inside and out, he's better than I am
[B] I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
[B] And I had the best days with you
[V] There is a video I found from back when I was three
[V] You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talkin' to me
[V] It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves
[V] Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
[C] Now I know why all the trees change in the fall
[C] I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
[C] And I love you for givin' me your eyes
[C] For staying back and watchin' me shine
[C] And I didn't know if you knew
[C] So I'm taking this chance to say
[C] That I had the best day with you today

[V] Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits ya
[V] Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
[V] You know it's all the same, another time and place
[V] Repeatin' history and you're gettin' sick of it
[C] But I believe in whatever you do
[C] And I'll do anything to see it through
[C] Because these things will change, can you feel it now?
[C] These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
[C] This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
[C] And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
[C] Oh, oh
[V] So we've been outnumbered, raided and, now, cornered
[V] It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
[V] We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
[V] They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
[C] You can walk away, say, "We don't need this"
[C] But there's somethin' in your eyes, says, "We can beat this"
[C] 'Cause these things will change, can you feel it now?
[C] These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
[C] This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
[C] And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
[C] Oh, oh-woah
[B] Tonight, we'll stand and get off our knees
[B] Fight for what we've worked for all these years
[B] And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
[B] But we'll stand up champions tonight
[C] It was the night things changed, can you see it now?
[C] When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
[C] It's a revolution, throw your hands up 'cause we never gave in
[C] And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah, oh
[I] Hallelujah

[V] I like the way you sound in the mornin'
[V] We're on the phone and without a warnin'
[V] I realize your laugh is the best sound
[V] I have ever heard
[V] I like the way I can't keep my focus
[V] I watch you talk, you didn't notice
[V] I hear the words, but all I can think is
[V] "We should be together"
[C] Every time you smile, I smile
[C] And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[V] You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh
[V] I've never been so wrapped up, honey
[V] I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
[V] I had time to think it oh-over
[V] And all I can say is, "Come closer"
[V] Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me
[C] 'Cause every time you smile, I smile
[C] And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[B] When people say things that bring you to your knees
[B] I'll catch you
[B] The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
[B] But I'll hold you through the night until you smile
[C] Woah-oh, I need you, baby

[C] Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun

[V] When my world wakes up today
[V] You'll be in another town
[V] And I knew when I saw your face
[V] I'd be counting down the ways to see you
[C] You smile that beautiful smile
[C] And all the girls in the front row
[C] Scream your name
[C] So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
[C] "I can't take my eyes off of you"
[C] I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
[C] Who's desperately in love with you
[C] Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
[C] Superstar
[B] You played in bars, you play guitar
[B] I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
[B] And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
[B] Every night from the radio
[C] So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
[C] "I can't take my eyes off of you"
[C] I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
[C] Who's desperately in love with you
[C] Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
[C] Superstar
[I] Sweet, sweet superstar
[I] Superstar

[V] In the heat of the fight, I walked away
[V] Ignorin' words that you were sayin', tryna make me stay
[V] I said, "This time I've had enough"
[V] And you've called a hundred times
[V] But I'm not pickin' up
[C] 'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over
[C] But if you look a little closer
[C] I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
[C] To stand outside my window, throwin' pebbles
[C] Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
[C] Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
[C] And don't you leave 'cause I know
[C] All I need is on the other side of the door
[V] Well, me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
[V] Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
[V] I keep goin' back over things we both said
[V] And I remember the slammin' door
[V] And all the things that I misread
[C] Oh, babe, if you know everything
[C] Tell me why you couldn't see
[C] When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah
[C] I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
[C] To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
[C] Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
[C] Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
[C] And don't you leave 'cause I know
[C] All I need is on the other side of the door
[B] And I'll scream out the window
[B] "I can't even look at you"
[B] I don't need you, but I do, I do, I do
[B] I say, "There's nothin' you can say
[B] To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"
[B] But what I mean is
[C] I said, "Leave," but, baby, all I want is you
[C] To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
[C] Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
[C] Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
[C] And don't you leave 'cause I know
[C] All I need is on the other side of the door
[I] With your face and the beautiful eyes
[I] And the conversation with the little white lies
[I] And the faded picture of a beautiful night
[I] You carried me from your car up the stairs
[I] And I broke down cryin', was she worth this mess?
[I] After everything and that little black dress
[I] After everything, I must confess
[I] I need you

[V] Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
[V] I used to be a damsel in distress
[V] You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
[V] Today was a fairytale
[V] Today was a fairytale
[V] Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
[V] You wore a dark gray T-shirt
[V] You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
[V] Today was a fairytale
[C] Time slows down
[C] Whenever you're around
[C] Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
[C] It must have been the way you kissed me
[C] Fell in love when I saw you standing there
[C] It must have been the way
[C] Today was a fairytale
[C] It must have been the way
[C] Today was a fairytale
[V] Today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
[V] That takes me to another planet
[V] Every move you make, everything you say is right
[V] Today was a fairytale
[V] Today was a fairytale, all that I can say
[V] Is, now it's gettin' so much clearer
[V] Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
[V] Today was a fairytale
[C] Time slows down
[C] Whenever you're around, yeah
[C] But can you feel this magic in the air?
[C] It must have been the way you kissed me
[C] Fell in love when I saw you standing there
[C] It must have been the way
[C] Today was a fairytale
[C] It must have been the way
[C] Today was a fairytale
[B] Time slows down
[B] Whenever you're around
[B] I can feel my heart
[B] It's beating in my chest
[B] Did you feel it?
[B] I can't put this down
[C] But can you feel this magic in the air?
[C] It must have been the way you kissed me
[C] Fell in love when I saw you standing there
[C] It must have been the way
[C] But can you feel this magic in the air?
[C] It must have been the way you kissed me
[C] Fell in love when I saw you standing there
[C] It must have been the way
[C] Today was a fairytale
[C] It must have been the way
[C] Today was a fairytale
[I] Oh, oh, yeah, woah
[I] Today was a fairytale

[V] Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
[V] Shouldn't I find a stain? But I never do
[V] The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
[V] They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
[V] You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know
[V] You can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
[V] But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
[V] You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me
[C] I lived and I learned
[C] Had you, got burned
[C] Held out and held on
[C] god knows, too long, and wasted time
[C] Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
[C] But no amount of freedom gets you clean
[C] I've still got you all over me
[V] The best and worst day of June
[V] Was the one that I met you
[V] With your hands in your pockets
[V] And your "Don't you wish you had me?" grin
[V] Well I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
[V] Now, every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then
[C] And I lived and I learned
[C] Had you, got burned
[C] Held out and held on
[C] god knows, too long, and wasted time
[C] Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
[C] But no amount of freedom gets you clean
[C] I've still got you all over me
[C] I lived and I learned
[C] And found out what it was to turn around
[C] And see that we
[C] Were never really meant to be
[C] So I lied, and I cried
[C] And I watched a part of myself die
[C] 'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
[C] I've still got you all over me
[I] I've still got you all over me
[I] Still got you all over me

[V] Mr. "Perfect face," Mr. "Here to stay"

[V] Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same
[C] Because I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
[C] I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her

[V] We used to walk along the streets
[V] When the porch lights were shinin' bright
[V] Before I had somewhere to be
[V] Back when we had all night
[V] And we were happy
[V] I do recall a good while back
[V] We snuck into the circus
[V] You threw your arms around my neck
[V] Back when I deserved it
[V] And we were happy
[C] When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
[C] We showed 'em all up
[C] No one could touch the way we
[C] Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
[C] We were gonna buy someday
[C] And we were happy
[V] We used to watch the Sun go down
[V] On the boats in the water
[V] That's sorta how I feel right now
[V] And goodbye's so much harder
[V] 'Cause we were happy
[C] When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
[C] We showed 'em all up
[C] No one could touch the way we
[C] Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
[C] We were gonna buy someday
[C] And we were happy
[C] We were happy
[B] Oh, I hate those voices
[B] Tellin' me I'm not in love anymore
[B] But they don't give me choices
[B] And that's what these tears are for
[C] 'Cause we were happy
[C] We were happy
[C] When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
[C] We showed 'em all up
[C] No one could touch the way we
[C] Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
[C] And you were gonna marry me
[C] And we were happy
[I] We were happy
[I] Oh, we were happy

[V] You said, "I know"
[V] When I said, "I need some time, need some space
[V] To think about all of this"
[V] And you watched me go
[V] And I knew my words were hard to hear
[V] And harder to ever take back
[C] And I said, "When can I come back?"
[C] And you said, "That's when
[C] When I wake up in the morning
[C] That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
[C] Laughin', when I'm cryin'
[C] And that's when
[C] I'll be waitin' at the front gate
[C] That's when, when I see your face
[C] I'll let you in and, baby, that's when"
[C] Mmm, mm
[V] I said, "I know"
[V] When you said, "I did you wrong, made mistakes
[V] And put you through all of this" (Through all of this)
[V] Then through the phone
[V] Came all your tears
[V] And I said, "Leave those all in our past"
[C] And you said, "When can I come back?"
[C] And I said, "That's when
[C] When I wake up in the morning
[C] That's when, when it's sunny or stormin'
[C] Laughin', when I'm cryin'
[C] And that's when
[C] I'll be waitin' at the front gate
[C] That's when, when I see your face
[C] I'll let you in and, baby, that's when"
[B] And you said, "Honestly
[B] When you were gone
[B] Did you ever think of me?"
[C] And I said, "That's when
[C] When I woke up in the morning
[C] That's when it was sunny or stormin'
[C] Laughin', when I was cryin'
[C] And that's when
[C] You were waitin' at the front gate
[C] That's when, when I saw your face
[C] You let me in, and baby, that's when"
[I] (That's when)
[I] (When I woke up in the morning) Yeah
[I] (That's when it was sunny or stormin')
[I] When I'm laughin', when I'm cryin'
[I] (That's when I'll be waitin' at the front gate)
[I] That's when I miss you, that's when I want you
[I] (That's when, when I see your face)
[I] That's when I love you, that's when

[V] Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
[V] It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
[V] I heard she's nothin' like me
[V] I'm sure she'll make you happy
[C] But don't you
[C] Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
[C] Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
[C] You don't know how much I feel I love you still
[C] So why don't you, don't you?
[V] Sometimes, I really wish that I could hate you
[V] I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
[V] My heart knows what the truth is
[V] I swore I wouldn't do this
[C] But don't you
[C] Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
[C] Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
[C] You don't know how much I feel I love you still
[C] So why don't you, don't you?
[B] So I'll walk out of here tonight
[B] Try to go on with my life
[B] And you can say we're still friends
[B] (But I don't wanna pretend)
[B] So if I see you again
[C] Don't you (Don't you)
[C] Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
[C] Don't you (Don't you) say you've missed me if you don't want me again
[C] You don't (You don't) know how much I feel I love you still
[C] So why don't you, don't you?
[I] Don't you

[V] It wasn't just like a movie
[V] The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
[V] I'm drivin' away and I, I guess you could say
[V] This is the last time I'll drive this way again
[V] Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
[V] 'Cause I, I still love you, but I can't
[C] Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
[C] Bye, bye, baby
[C] I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
[C] And all I have is your sympathy
[C] 'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
[C] Bye, bye, baby
[C] Bye, bye, baby
[V] The picture frame is empty
[V] On the dresser, vacant just like me
[V] I see your writing on the dash
[V] Then back to your hesitation
[V] I was so sure of everything
[V] Everything I thought we'd always have
[V] Guess I never doubted it
[V] Then the here and the now floods in
[V] Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past
[C] Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
[C] Bye, bye, baby
[C] I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
[C] And all I have is your sympathy
[C] 'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
[C] Bye, bye, baby
[B] And there's so much that I can't touch
[B] You're all I want, but it's not enough this time
[B] And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
[B] And I'm so scared of how this ends
[C] Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
[C] Bye, bye, baby
[C] I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
[C] And all I have is your sympathy
[C] 'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
[C] Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
[C] Bye, bye, baby

[C] 'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
[C] Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
[C] Bye, bye, baby
[C] Bye, bye, baby

[V] I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
[V] Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
[V] I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
[V] I hit the ground running each night
[V] I hit the Sunday matinée
[V] You know the greatest films of all time were never made
[C] I guess you never know, never know
[C] And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
[C] And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
[C] And it's alright now
[C] But we were something, don't you think so?
[C] Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
[C] And if my wishes came true
[C] It would've been you
[C] In my defense, I have none
[C] For never leaving well enough alone
[C] But it would've been fun
[C] If you would've been the one
[C] (Ooh)
[V] I have this dream you're doing cool shit
[V] Having adventures on your own
[V] You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
[V] We never painted by the numbers, baby
[V] But we were making it count
[V] You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
[C] I guess you never know, never know
[C] And it's another day waking up alone
[C] But we were something, don't you think so?
[C] Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
[C] And if my wishes came true
[C] It would've been you
[C] In my defense, I have none
[C] For never leaving well enough alone
[C] But it would've been fun
[C] If you would've been the one
[B] I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
[B] If one thing had been different
[B] Would everything be different today?
[C] We were something, don't you think so?
[C] Rosé flowing with your chosen family
[C] And it would've been sweet
[C] If it could've been me
[C] In my defense, I have none
[C] For digging up the grave another time
[C] But it would've been fun
[C] If you would've been the one
[C] (Ooh)

[C] Drunk under a streetlight, I
[C] I knew you

[V] Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
[V] Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St.-Louis
[V] Bill was the heir to the Standard-Oil name and money
[V] And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
[V] The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
[V] There's only so far new money goes
[V] They picked out a home and called it "Holiday-House"
[V] Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
[V] The doctor had told him to settle down
[V] It must have been her fault his heart gave out
[C] And they said
[C] "There goes the last great American dynasty
[C] Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
[C] There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
[C] She had a marvelous time ruining everything"
[V] Rebekah gave up on the Rhode-Island set forever
[V] Flew in all her Bitch-Pack friends from the city
[V] Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
[V] And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
[V] And losing on card game bets with Dalí
[C] And they said
[C] "There goes the last great American dynasty
[C] Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
[C] There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
[C] She had a marvelous time ruining everything"
[B] They say she was seen on occasion
[B] Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
[B] And in a feud with her neighbor
[B] She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
[B] Fifty years is a long time
[B] Holiday-House sat quietly on that beach
[B] Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
[B] And then it was bought by me
[C] Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
[C] There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
[C] I had a marvelous time ruining everything
[I] I had a marvelous time ruining everything

[V] I can see you standing, honey
[V] With his arms around your body
[V] Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
[V] And it took you five whole minutes
[V] To pack us up and leave me with it
[V] Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
[C] I think I've seen this film before
[C] And I didn't like the ending

[V] Those eyes add insult to injury
[C] I think I've seen this film before
[C] And I didn't like the ending
[C] I'm not your problem anymore
[C] So who am I offending now?
[C] You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
[C] I think I've seen this film before
[C] So I'm leaving out the side door
[B] So step right out, there is no amount
[B] Of crying I can do for you
[B] All this time
[B] We always walked a very thin line
[B] You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
[B] You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
[B] All this time
[B] I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
[B] I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
[B] 'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
[B] So many signs, so many signs
[B] You didn't even see the signs
[C] I think I've seen this film before
[C] And I didn't like the ending
[C] You're not my homeland anymore
[C] So what am I defending now?
[C] You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
[C] I think I've seen this film before
[C] So I'm leavin' out the side door
[I] So step right out, there is no amount
[I] Of crying I can do for you
[I] All this time
[I] We always walked a very thin line
[I] You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
[I] You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
[I] All this time
[I] I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
[I] I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
[I] 'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
[I] You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
[I] (So many times) I never learned to read your mind
[I] (So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
[I] 'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
[I] You never gave a warning sign
[I] Ah, ah

[V] We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
[V] And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
[V] Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
[V] All the hell you gave me?
[V] 'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
[V] 'Til my dying day
[C] I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
[C] And you're the hero flying around, saving face
[C] And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
[C] Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
[C] Look at how my tears ricochet
[V] We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
[V] Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
[V] You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
[V] But what a ghostly scene
[V] You wear the same jewels that I gave you
[V] As you bury me
[C] I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
[C] 'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
[C] And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
[C] Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
[C] Look at how my tears ricochet
[B] And I can go anywhere I want
[B] Anywhere I want, just not home
[B] And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
[B] But you would still miss me in your bones
[B] And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
[B] And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)
[C] I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
[C] And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
[C] You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
[C] Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
[C] You turned into your worst fears
[C] And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
[C] Crossing out the good years
[C] And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
[C] Look at how my tears ricochet

[V] I want you to know
[V] I'm a mirrorball
[V] I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
[V] I'll get you out on the floor
[V] Shimmering beautiful
[V] And when I break, it's in a million pieces
[C] Hush, when no one is around, my dear
[C] You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
[C] Spinning in my highest heels, love
[C] Shining just for you
[C] Hush, I know they said the end is near
[C] But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
[C] Spinning in my highest heels, love
[C] Shining just for you
[V] I want you to know
[V] I'm a mirrorball
[V] I can change everything about me to fit in
[V] You are not like the regulars
[V] The masquerade revelers
[V] Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
[C] Hush, when no one is around, my dear
[C] You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
[C] Spinning in my highest heels, love
[C] Shining just for you
[C] Hush, I know they said the end is near
[C] But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
[C] Spinning in my highest heels, love
[C] Shining just for you
[B] And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
[B] When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
[B] I'm still on that tightrope
[B] I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
[B] And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
[B] I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
[B] I'm still on that trapeze
[B] I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me
[I] Because I'm a mirrorball
[I] I'm a mirrorball
[I] And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight

[V] Please picture me in the trees
[V] I hit my peak at seven
[V] Feet in the swing over the creek
[V] I was too scared to jump in
[V] But I, I was high in the sky
[V] With Pennsylvania under me
[V] Are there still beautiful things?
[C] Sweet tea in the summer
[C] Cross your heart, won't tell no other
[C] And though I can't recall your face
[C] I still got love for you
[C] Your braids like a pattern
[C] Love you to the moon and to Saturn
[C] Passed down like folk songs
[C] The love lasts so long
[B] And I've been meaning to tell you
[B] I think your house is haunted
[B] Your dad is always mad and that must be why
[B] And I think you should come live with me
[B] And we can be pirates
[B] Then you won't have to cry
[B] Or hide in the closet
[B] And just like a folk song
[B] Our love will be passed on
[V] Please picture me in the weeds
[V] Before I learned civility
[V] I used to scream ferociously
[V] Any time I wanted
[V] I, I
[C] Sweet tea in the summer
[C] Cross my heart, won't tell no other
[C] And though I can't recall your face
[C] I still got love for you
[C] Pack your dolls and a sweater
[C] We'll move to India forever
[C] Passed down like folk songs
[C] Our love lasts so long

[V] Salt air, and the rust on your door
[V] I never needed anything more
[V] Whispers of "Are you sure?"
[V] "Never have I ever before"
[C] But I can see us lost in the memory
[C] August slipped away into a moment in time
[C] 'Cause it was never mine
[C] And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
[C] August sipped away like a bottle of wine
[C] 'Cause you were never mine
[V] Your back beneath the sun
[V] Wishin' I could write my name on it
[V] Will you call when you're back at school?
[V] I remember thinkin' I had you
[C] But I can see us lost in the memory
[C] August slipped away into a moment in time
[C] 'Cause it was never mine
[C] And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
[C] August sipped away like a bottle of wine
[C] 'Cause you were never mine
[B] Back when we were still changin' for the better
[B] Wanting was enough
[B] For me, it was enough
[B] To live for the hope of it all
[B] Cancel plans just in case you'd call
[B] And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
[B] So much for summer love and saying "us"
[B] 'Cause you weren't mine to lose
[B] You weren't mine to lose, no
[C] But I can see us lost in the memory
[C] August slipped away into a moment in time
[C] 'Cause it was never mine
[C] And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
[C] August sipped away like a bottle of wine
[C] 'Cause you were never mine
[I] 'Cause you were never mine
[I] Never mine
[I] But do you remember?
[I] Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
[I] And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
[I] Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
[I] "Meet me behind the mall"
[I] (Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car")
[I] (And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
[I] (Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
[I] ("Meet me behind the mall")
[I] Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
[I] And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
[I] Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
[I] For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
[I] (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

[V] I've been having a hard time adjusting
[V] I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
[V] I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
[V] I have a lot of regrets about that
[V] Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
[V] Could've followed my fears all the way down
[V] And maybe I don't quite know what to say
[V] But I'm here in your doorway
[C] I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
[C] I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
[V] They told me all of my cages were mental
[V] So I got wasted like all my potential
[V] And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
[V] I have a lot of regrets about that
[V] I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
[V] Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
[V] Pouring out my heart to a stranger
[V] But I didn't pour the whiskey
[C] I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
[C] I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
[C] At least I'm trying
[B] And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
[B] It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
[B] You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town
[C] And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
[C] (And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
[C] I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
[I] At least I'm trying

[V] Make sure nobody sees you leave
[V] Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
[V] Tell your friends you're out for a run
[V] You'll be flushed when you return
[V] Take the road less traveled by
[V] Tell yourself you can always stop
[V] What started in beautiful rooms
[V] Ends with meetings in parking lots
[C] And that's the thing about illicit affairs
[C] And clandestine meetings and longing stares
[C] It's born from just one single glance
[C] But it dies and it dies and it dies
[C] A million little times
[V] Leave the perfume on the shelf
[V] That you picked out just for him
[V] So you leave no trace behind
[V] Like you don't even exist
[V] Take the words for what they are
[V] A dwindling, mercurial high
[V] A drug that only worked
[V] The first few hundred times
[C] And that's the thing about illicit affairs
[C] And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
[C] They show their truth one single time
[C] But they lie and they lie and they lie
[C] A million little times
[B] And you wanna scream
[B] Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
[B] Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
[B] You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
[B] Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
[B] Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
[B] You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else
[I] And you know damn well
[I] For you, I would ruin myself
[I] A million little times

[V] Green was the color of the grass
[V] Where I used to read at Centennial-Park
[V] I used to think I would meet somebody there
[V] Teal was the color of your shirt
[V] When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
[V] You used to work at to make a little money
[C] Time, curious time
[C] Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
[C] Were there clues I didn't see?
[C] And isn't it just so pretty to think
[C] All along there was some
[C] Invisible string
[C] Tying you to me?
[C] Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[V] Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
[V] On your first trip to L.A.
[V] You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
[V] Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
[V] Getting lunch down by The-Lakes
[V] She said I looked like an American singer
[C] Time, mystical time
[C] Cutting me open, then healing me fine
[C] Were there clues I didn't see?
[C] And isn't it just so pretty to think
[C] All along there was some
[C] Invisible string
[C] Tying you to me?
[C] Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[B] A string that pulled me
[B] Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
[B] Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
[B] Chains around my demons
[B] Wool to brave the seasons
[B] One single thread of gold
[B] Tied me to you
[V] Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
[V] For the boys who broke my heart
[V] Now I send their babies presents
[V] Gold was the color of the leaves
[V] When I showed you around Centennial-Park
[V] Hell was the journey, but it brought me heaven
[C] Time, wondrous time
[C] Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
[C] And it's cool, baby, with me
[C] And isn't it just so pretty to think
[C] All along there was some
[C] Invisible string
[C] Tying you to me?
[C] Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[C] Me
[C] Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
[I] (Ah-ah-ah)
[I] (Ah-ah-ah)

[V] What did you think I'd say to that?
[V] Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
[V] They strike to kill, and you know I will
[V] You know I will
[V] What do you sing on your drive home?
[V] Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
[V] Does she smile?
[V] Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?
[C] Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
[C] What about that?
[C] And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
[C] And there's nothing like a mad woman
[C] What a shame she went mad
[C] No one likes a mad woman
[C] You made her like that
[C] And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
[C] And you find something to wrap your noose around
[C] And there's nothing like a mad woman
[V] Now I breathe flames each time I talk
[V] My cannons all firin' at your yacht
[V] They say, "Move on," but you know I won't
[V] And women like hunting witches too
[V] Doing your dirtiest work for you
[V] It's obvious that wanting me dead
[V] Has really brought you two together
[C] Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
[C] What about that?
[C] And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
[C] And there's nothing like a mad woman
[C] What a shame she went mad
[C] No one likes a mad woman
[C] You made her like that
[C] And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
[C] And you find something to wrap your noose around
[C] And there's nothing like a mad woman
[B] I'm taking my time, taking my time
[B] 'Cause you took everything from me
[B] Watching you climb, watching you climb
[B] Over people like me
[B] The master of spin has a couple side flings
[B] Good wives always know
[B] She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but
[B] No one likes a mad woman
[I] What a shame she went mad
[I] You made her like that

[V] Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
[V] Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
[V] Crawling up the beaches now
[V] "Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
[V] And some things you just can't speak about
[C] With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
[C] Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
[V] Something med school did not cover
[V] Someone's daughter, someone's mother
[V] Holds your hand through plastic now
[V] "Doc, I think she's crashing out"
[V] And some things you just can't speak about
[B] Only twenty minutes to sleep
[B] But you dream of some epiphany
[B] Just one single glimpse of relief
[B] To make some sense of what you've seen
[C] With you I serve, with you I fall down, down (Down)
[C] Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
[C] With you I serve (With you I serve), with you I fall down (Down), down (Down)
[C] Watch you breathe in (Watch you breathe in), watch you breathing out (Out), out (Out)
[I] Only twenty minutes to sleep
[I] But you dream of some epiphany
[I] Just one single glimpse of relief
[I] To make some sense of what you've seen

[V] Betty, I won't make assumptions
[V] About why you switched your homeroom, but
[V] I think it's 'cause of me
[V] Betty, one time, I was riding on my skateboard
[V] When I passed your house
[V] It's like I couldn't breathe
[C] You heard the rumors from Inez
[C] You can't believe a word she says
[C] Most times, but this time, it was true
[C] The worst thing that I ever did
[C] Was what I did to you
[C] But if I just showed up at your party
[C] Would you have me? Would you want me?
[C] Would you tell me to go fuck myself
[C] Or lead me to the garden?
[C] In the garden, would you trust me
[C] If I told you it was just a summer thing?
[C] I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
[C] But I know I miss you
[V] Betty, I know where it all went wrong
[V] Your favorite song was playing
[V] From the far side of the gym
[V] I was nowhere to be found
[V] I hate the crowds, you know that
[V] Plus, I saw you dance with him
[C] You heard the rumors from Inez
[C] You can't believe a word she says
[C] Most times, but this time, it was true
[C] The worst thing that I ever did
[C] Was what I did to you
[C] But if I just showed up at your party
[C] Would you have me? Would you want me?
[C] Would you tell me to go fuck myself
[C] Or lead me to the garden?
[C] In the garden, would you trust me
[C] If I told you it was just a summer thing?
[C] I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
[C] But I know I miss you
[B] I was walking home on broken cobblestones
[B] Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
[B] A figment of my worst intentions
[B] She said, "James, get in, let's drive"
[B] Those days turned into nights
[B] Slept next to her, but
[B] I dreamt of you all summer long
[V] Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
[V] And I planned it out for weeks now
[V] But it's finally sinkin' in
[V] Betty, right now is the last time
[V] I can dream about what happens when
[V] You see my face again
[C] The only thing I wanna do
[C] Is make it up to you
[C] So I showed up at your party
[C] Yeah, I showed up at your party
[C] Yeah, I showed up at your party
[C] Will you have me? Will you love me?
[C] Will you kiss me on the porch
[C] In front of all your stupid friends?
[C] If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
[C] Will it patch your broken wings?
[C] I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
[C] But I know I miss you
[I] Standing in your cardigan
[I] Kissin' in my car again
[I] Stopped at a streetlight
[I] You know I miss you

[V] Our coming-of-age has come and gone
[V] Suddenly, this summer, it's clear
[V] I never had the courage of my convictions
[V] As long as danger is near
[V] And it's just around the corner, darlin'
[V] 'Cause it lives in me
[V] No, I could never give you peace
[C] But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
[C] If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
[C] All these people think love's for show
[C] But I would die for you in secret
[C] The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
[C] Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
[V] Your integrity makes me seem small
[V] You paint dreamscapes on the wall
[V] I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
[V] And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
[V] Sit with you in the trenches
[V] Give you my wild, give you a child
[V] Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
[V] Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
[V] Is it enough?
[V] But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
[V] I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
[V] But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me
[C] But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
[C] If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
[C] All these people think love's for show
[C] But I would die for you in secret
[C] The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
[C] Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
[C] Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
[C] Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[V] My only one
[V] My smoking gun
[V] My eclipsed sun
[V] This has broken me down
[V] My twisted knife
[V] My sleepless night
[V] My winless fight
[V] This has frozen my ground
[C] Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
[C] Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
[C] Don't want no other shade of blue but you
[C] No other sadness in the world would do
[V] My best laid plan
[V] Your sleight of hand
[V] My barren land
[V] I am ash from your fire
[C] Stood on the cliffside screaming, "Give me a reason"
[C] Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
[C] Don't want no other shade of blue but you
[C] No other sadness in the world would do
[B] You know I left a part of me back in New-York
[B] You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
[B] You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
[B] From when they pulled me apart
[B] You knew the password so I let you in the door
[B] You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
[B] You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
[B] From when they pulled me apart
[B] But what you did was just as dark
[B] (Ah, ah, ah)
[B] Darling, this was just as hard
[B] As when they pulled me apart
[I] My only one
[I] My kingdom come undone
[I] My broken drum
[I] You have beaten my heart
[I] Don't want no other shade of blue but you
[I] No other sadness in the world would do

[V] Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
[V] I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
[V] These hunters with cell phones
[C] Take me to The-Lakes, where all the poets went to die
[C] I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
[C] Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
[C] I'm setting off, but not without my muse
[V] What should be over, burrowed under my skin
[V] In heart-stopping waves of hurt
[V] I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
[V] Tell me what are my words worth
[C] Take me to The-Lakes, where all the poets went to die
[C] I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
[C] Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
[C] I'm setting off, but not without my muse
[B] I want auroras and sad prose
[B] I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
[B] 'Cause I haven't moved in years
[B] And I want you right here
[B] A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
[B] With no one around to tweet it
[B] While I bathe in cliffside pools
[B] With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief
[C] Take me to The-Lakes, where all the poets went to die
[C] I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
[C] Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
[C] I'm setting off, but not without my muse
[C] No, not without you

[V] I heard you calling on the megaphone
[V] You wanna see me all alone
[V] As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
[V] You light the match to watch it blow
[C] And if you'd never come for me
[C] I might've drowned in the melancholy

[V] I'm the one you want
[V] You give it different meaning 'cause you mean it when you talk
[V] Sweetie, it's yours, kicking in doors
[V] Take it to the floor, give me more
[V] Buy the paint in the color of your eyes (Of your eyes)
[V] And graffiti my whole damn life, honey
[C] When anyone called me late night
[C] He was screwing around with my mind
[C] Asking, "What are you wearing?", too high
[C] To remember in the morning
[C] And when anyone called me "lovely"
[C] They were finding ways not to praise me
[C] But you say it like you're in awe of me
[C] And you stay until the morning
[C] Honey
[C] When anyone called me "sweetheart"
[C] It was passive-aggressive at the bar
[C] And the bitch was telling me to back off
[C] 'Cause her man had looked at me wrong (He looked at me wrong)
[C] If anyone called me "honey" (Ooh)
[C] It was standing in the bathroom (Yeah), white teeth
[C] They were saying that skirt don't fit me
[C] And I cried the whole way home (Cried the whole way home)
[I] But you can call me "honey" if you want

[V] Her name was Kitty
[V] Made her money being pretty and witty
[V] They gave her the keys to this city
[V] Then they said she didn't do it legitly, oh
[V] I bought a ticket
[V] She's dancing in her garters and fishnets
[V] Fifty in the cast, zero missteps
[V] Looking back, I guess it was kismet
[C] I waited by the stage door, packed in with the autograph hounds
[C] Barking her name, then glowing like the end of a cigarette, wow, she came out
[C] I said, "You're living my drеam"
[C] Then she said to me
[C] "Hеy, thank you for the lovely bouquet
[C] You're sweeter than a peach
[C] But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
[C] And you're never, ever gonna
[C] Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
[C] You're softer than a kitten, so
[C] You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
[C] And you're never gonna wanna"
[V] She was a menace
[V] The baby of the family in Lenox
[V] Her father whored around like all men did
[V] Her mother took pills and played tennis
[C] So she waited by the stage door as the club promoter arrived
[C] She said, "I'd sell my soul to have a taste of a magnificent life that's all mine"
[C] But that's not what showgirls get
[C] They leave us for dead
[C] Hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet
[C] You're sweeter than a peach
[C] But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
[C] And you're never, ever gonna
[C] Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
[C] You're softer than a kitten, so
[C] You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
[C] And you're never gonna wanna
[B] I took her pearls of wisdom, hung them from my neck
[B] I paid my dues with every bruise, I knew what to expect
[B] Do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins?
[B] They ripped me off like false lashes and then threw me away
[B] And all the headshots on the walls
[B] Of the dance hall are of the bitches
[B] Who wish I'd hurry up and die
[B] But I'm immortal now, baby dolls
[B] I couldn't if I tried
[B] So I say
[C] "Thank you for the lovely bouquet
[C] I'm married to the hustle
[C] And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe
[C] And I'll never know another
[C] Pain hidden by the lipstick and lace (Lipstick and lace)
[C] Sequins are forever
[C] And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe
[C] Wouldn't have it any other way" (Wouldn't have it any other way)
[C] (Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
[C] Oh, wouldn't have it any other way
[C] (Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
[C] Hey, Kitty
[C] (Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
[C] Now I make my money being pretty and witty
[C] Thank you for the lovely bouquet
[I] Thank you for an unforgettable night
[I] We will see you next time
[I] Give it up for the band
[I] And the dancers
[I] And of course, Sabrina
[I] I love you, Taylor
[I] That's our show
[I] We love you so much
[I] Goodnight

[V] How many days did I spend thinking
[V] 'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
[V] Lived in the shade you were throwing
[V] 'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
[V] And I couldn't get away from ya
[V] In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
[V] Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
[V] Free rent, living in my mind
[C] But then something happened one magical night
[C] I forgot that you existed
[C] And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
[C] And it was so nice
[C] So peaceful and quiet
[C] I forgot that you existed
[C] It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
[C] I forgot that you
[V] Got out some popcorn
[V] As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
[V] Laughed on the school yard
[V] As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
[V] And I would've stuck around for ya
[V] Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
[V] Would've been right there, front row
[V] Even if nobody came to your show
[C] But you showed who you are, then one magical night
[C] I forgot that you existed
[C] And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
[C] And it was so nice
[C] So peaceful and quiet
[C] I forgot that you existed
[C] It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
[C] I forgot that you
[B] Sent me a clear message
[B] Taught me some hard lessons
[B] I just forget what they were
[B] It's all just a blur
[C] I forgot that you existed
[C] And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
[C] And it was so nice
[C] So peaceful and quiet
[C] I forgot that you existed
[C] I did, I did, I did
[C] It isn't hate, it's just indifference
[C] It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
[C] So, yeah

[I] (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
[V] Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
[V] You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
[V] Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
[V] You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
[C] Killing me slow, out the window
[C] I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
[C] Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
[C] What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
[C] And it's new, the shape of your body
[C] It's blue, the feeling I've got
[C] And it's ooh, woah-oh
[C] It's a cruel summer
[C] It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
[C] No rules in breakable heaven
[C] But ooh, woah-oh
[C] It's a cruel summer with you
[V] Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
[V] I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
[V] We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
[V] We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
[C] So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
[C] I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
[C] Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
[C] And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh
[C] It's new, the shape of your body
[C] It's blue, the feeling I've got
[C] And it's ooh, woah-oh
[C] It's a cruel summer
[C] It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
[C] No rules in breakable heaven
[C] But ooh, woah-oh
[C] It's a cruel summer with you
[B] I'm drunk in the back of the car
[B] And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
[B] Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
[B] I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
[B] And I snuck in through the garden gate
[B] Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
[B] And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
[B] I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
[B] He looks up, grinnin' like a devil
[C] It's new, the shape of your body
[C] It's blue, the feeling I've got
[C] And it's ooh, woah-oh
[C] It's a cruel summer

[I] And I snuck in through the garden gate
[I] Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
[I] And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
[I] I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
[I] (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[V] We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
[V] And this is our place, we make the rules
[V] And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
[V] Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
[C] Can I go where you go?
[C] Can we always be this close?
[C] Forever and ever, ah
[C] Take me out and take me home
[C] You're my, my, my, my lover
[V] We could let our friends crash in the living room
[V] This is our place, we make the call
[V] And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
[V] I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[B] All's well that ends well to end up with you
[B] Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

[V] I would be complex, I would be cool
[V] They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
[V] And that would be okay for me to do
[V] Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
[C] I'd be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
[C] When everyone believes ya, what's that like?
[C] I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
[C] Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man

[V] They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
[V] What I was wearing, if I was rude
[V] Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
[C] And they would toast to me, oh (Ayy), let the players play
[C] I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez
[C] I'm so sick of running as fast as I can

[C] I'd be the man (Man)
[B] What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
[B] And getting bitches and models?
[B] And it's all good if you're bad
[B] And it's okay if you're mad
[B] If I was out flashin' my dollars
[B] I'd be a bitch, not a baller
[B] They'd paint me out to be bad
[B] So it's okay that I'm mad
[C] I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
[C] Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
[C] And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again (Comin' at me again)
[C] 'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
[C] I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
[C] Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)

[C] Easy they come, easy they go
[C] I jump from the train, I ride off alone

[V] Dark side, I search for your dark side
[V] But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
[V] And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
[V] Then I hate my reflection for years and years
[C] I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
[C] The room is on fire, invisible smoke
[C] And all of my heroes die all alone

[V] You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
[V] Than I was at sixteen, lost in a film scene
[V] Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
[V] I'm lost in the lights

[V] Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
[V] Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
[V] And ran for my life (Ah)

[V] Who seems to care
[V] American stories burning before me

[V] The moon is high
[V] Like your friends were the night that we first met
[V] Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
[V] Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
[V] The wine is cold

[V] When you jumped in first, I went in too
[V] I'm with you even if it makes me blue
[V] Which takes me back
[V] To the color that we painted your brother's wall
[V] Honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws
[V] We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

[V] We were in the backseat
[V] Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
[V] "I rent a place on Cornelia-Street"
[V] I say casually in the car
[V] We were a fresh page on the desk
[V] Filling in the blanks as we go
[V] As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
[V] Leading us home
[C] And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends

[V] Back when we were card sharks, playing games
[V] I thought you were leading me on
[V] I packed my bags, left Cornelia-Street
[V] Before you even knew I was gone
[C] But then you called, showed your hand
[C] I turned around before I hit the tunnel
[C] Sat on the roof, you and I

[C] Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
[C] Flashbacks waking me up
[C] I get drunk, but it's not enough
[C] 'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
[C] I look through the windows of this love
[C] Even though we boarded them up
[C] Chandelier's still flickering here
[C] 'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
[C] It's death by a thousand cuts
[V] I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
[V] I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
[V] They say, "I don't know"
[V] And what once was ours is no one's now
[V] I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
[V] Is this small town
[V] You said it was a great love, one for the ages
[V] But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?
[C] 'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
[C] Flashbacks waking me up
[C] I get drunk, but it's not enough
[C] 'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby

[B] My heart, my hips, my body, my love
[B] Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
[B] Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
[B] Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
[B] Our songs, our films, united we stand
[B] Our country, guess it was a lawless land
[B] Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
[B] Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
[B] My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
[B] Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
[B] Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough
[B] But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[C] No, it's not
[C] It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)
[C] Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
[C] My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
[C] But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no
[I] I take the long way home
[I] I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
[I] They say, "I don't know"

[V] When the morning came
[V] We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
[V] 'Cause we lost track of time again
[V] Laughing with my feet in your lap
[V] Like you were my closest friend
[V] "How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?" you say
[V] "Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how"
[V] I see you every day now
[C] And I chose you
[C] The one I was dancing with
[C] In New-York, no shoes
[C] Looked up at the sky and it was
[C] The burgundy on my t-shirt
[C] When you splashed your wine into me
[C] And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
[C] So scarlet, it was
[C] The mark they saw on my collarbone
[C] The rust that grew between telephones
[C] The lips I used to call home
[C] So scarlet, it was maroon
[V] When the silence came
[V] We were shaking, blind and hazy
[V] How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
[V] Sobbing with your head in your hands
[V] Ain't that the way shit always ends?
[V] You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
[V] Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
[V] I feel you, no matter what
[V] The rubies that I gave up
[C] And I lost you
[C] The one I was dancing with
[C] In New-York, no shoes
[C] Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
[C] The burgundy on my t-shirt
[C] When you splashed your wine into me
[C] And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
[C] So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
[C] The mark they saw on my collarbone
[C] The rust that grew between telephones
[C] The lips I used to call home
[C] So scarlet, it was maroon
[B] And I wake with your memory over me
[B] That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
[B] And I wake with your memory over me
[B] That's a real fucking legacy to leave
[C] The burgundy on my t-shirt
[C] When you splashed your wine into me
[C] And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
[C] So scarlet, it was maroon
[C] The mark they saw on my collarbone
[C] The rust that grew between telephones
[C] The lips I used to call home
[C] So scarlet, it was maroon
[I] It was maroon

[V] I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
[V] Midnights become my afternoons
[V] When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
[V] I've ghosted stand there in the room
[C] I should not be left to my own devices
[C] They come with prices and vices
[C] I end up in crisis
[C] (Tale as old as time)
[C] I wake up screaming from dreaming
[C] One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
[C] 'Cause you got tired of my scheming
[C] (For the last time)
[C] It's me, hi
[C] I'm the problem, it's me
[C] At teatime, everybody agrees
[C] I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
[C] It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
[V] Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
[V] And I'm a monster on the hill
[V] Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
[V] Pierced through the heart, but never killed
[C] Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
[C] Like some kind of congressman?
[C] (A tale as old as time)
[C] I wake up screaming from dreaming
[C] One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
[C] And life will lose all its meaning
[C] (For the last time)
[C] It's me, hi
[C] I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
[C] At teatime, everybody agrees
[C] I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
[C] It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
[B] I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
[B] She thinks I left them in the will
[B] The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
[B] "She's laughing up at us from Hell"
[B] It's me, hi
[B] I'm the problem, it's me
[B] It's me, hi
[B] I'm the problem, it's me
[B] It's me, hi

[C] At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
[C] I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
[C] It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[V] Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
[V] I play it cool with the best of them
[V] I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
[V] It's okay, we're the best of friends
[V] Anyway
[V] I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
[V] I touch my phone as if it's your face
[V] I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
[V] There's just one who could make me stay
[V] All my days
[C] From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
[C] I waited ages to see you there
[C] I search the party of better bodies
[C] Just to learn that you never cared
[C] You're on your own, kid
[C] You always have been
[V] I see the great escape, so long, Daisy-May
[V] I picked the petals, he loves me not
[V] Something different bloomed, writing in my room
[V] I play my songs in the parking lot
[V] I'll run away
[C] From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
[C] I called a taxi to take me there
[C] I search the party of better bodies
[C] Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
[C] You're on your own, kid
[C] You always have been
[B] From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
[B] I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
[B] I hosted parties and starved my body
[B] Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
[B] The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
[B] My friends from home don't know what to say
[B] I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
[B] And I saw something they can't take away
[B] 'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
[B] Everything you lose is a step you take
[B] So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
[B] You've got no reason to be afraid
[C] You're on your own, kid
[C] Yeah, you can face this
[C] You're on your own, kid
[C] You always have been

[I] Rain
[I] He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
[I] He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
[I] Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
[I] All of me changed like midnight
[V] My town was a wasteland
[V] Full of cages, full of fences
[V] Pageant queens and big pretenders
[V] But for some, it was paradise
[V] My boy was a montage
[V] A slow-motion, love potion
[V] Jumping off things in the ocean
[V] I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
[V] He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
[C] He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
[C] He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
[C] Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
[C] All of me changed like midnight
[V] It came like a postcard
[V] Picture perfect shiny family
[V] Holiday peppermint candy
[V] But for him, it's every day
[V] So I peered through a window
[V] A deep portal, time travel
[V] All the love we unravel
[V] And the life I gave away
[V] 'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain
[C] He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
[C] He wanted a bride, I was making my own name

[I] I guess sometimes we all get
[I] Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
[I] And he never thinks of me
[I] Except for when I'm on TV
[I] I guess sometimes we all get
[I] Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
[I] And I never think of him
[I] Except on midnights like this
[I] (Midnights like this, midnights like this)

[I] I remember
[V] Good girl, sad boy

[C] Of a chain reaction of countermoves
[C] To assess the equation of you
[C] Checkmate, I couldn't lose
[C] What if I told you none of it was accidental?

[V] And maybe it was egos swinging
[V] Maybe it was her
[V] Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur
[C] All that bloodshed, crimson clover
[C] Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
[C] My hand was the one you reached for
[C] All throughout the Great-War
[C] Always remember
[C] Uh-huh, tears on the letter
[C] I vowed not to cry anymore
[C] If we survived the Great-War
[V] You drew up some good faith treaties
[V] I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone
[V] You said I have to trust more freely
[V] But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire
[V] And maybe it's the past that's talking
[V] Screaming from the crypt
[V] Telling me to punish you for things you never did
[V] So I justified it
[C] All that bloodshed, crimson clover
[C] Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
[C] My hand was the one you reached for
[C] All throughout the Great-War
[C] Always remember
[C] Uh-huh, the burning embers
[C] I vowed not to fight anymore
[C] If we survived the Great-War
[C] Uh-huh, uh-huh
[B] It turned into something bigger
[B] Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed
[B] Your finger on my hairpin triggers
[B] Soldier down on that icy ground
[B] Looked up at me with honor and truth
[B] Broken and blue, so I called off the troops
[B] That was the night I nearly lost you
[B] I really thought I'd lost you
[V] We can plant a memory garden
[V] Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
[V] There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair
[V] And we will never go back
[C] To that bloodshed, crimson clover
[C] Uh-huh, the worst was over
[C] My hand was the one you reached for
[C] All throughout the Great-War
[C] Always remember
[C] Uh-huh, we're burned for better
[C] I vowed I would always be yours
[C] 'Cause we survived the Great-War
[I] Uh-huh, uh-huh
[I] I will always be yours
[I] 'Cause we survived the Great-War
[I] Uh-huh
[I] I vow I will always be yours

[V] No words appear before me in the aftermath
[V] Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
[V] Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
[V] 'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea
[C] Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
[C] You were bigger than the whole sky
[C] You were more than just a short time
[C] And I've got a lot to pine about
[C] I've got a lot to live without
[C] I'm never gonna meet
[C] What could've been, would've been
[C] What should've been you
[C] What could've been, would've been you
[V] Did some bird flap its wings over in Asia?
[V] Did some force take you because I didn't pray?
[V] Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
[V] 'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
[V] So I'll say words I don't believe
[C] Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
[C] You were bigger than the whole sky
[C] You were more than just a short time
[C] And I've got a lot to pine about
[C] I've got a lot to live without
[C] I'm never gonna meet
[C] What could've been, would've been
[C] What should've been you
[B] What could've been, would've been you
[B] What could've been, would've been
[B] What should've been you
[B] What could've been, would've been you
[B] (What could've been, would've been you)
[C] Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
[C] You were bigger than the whole sky
[C] You were more than just a short time

[V] "Your ex-friend's sister

[V] Spit me out at the first chance

[V] Gone along with the righteous
[V] If I never blushed, then they could've
[V] Never whispered about this
[V] And if you never saved me from boredom
[V] I could've gone on as I was
[V] But, Lord, you made me feel important

[V] I washed my hands of us at the club

[V] One look, dark room, meant just for you
[V] Time moved too fast, you play it back
[V] Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke

[V] I've known it from the very start
[V] We're a shot in the darkest dark
[V] Oh no, oh no, I'm unarmed
[V] The waiting is a sadness
[V] Fading into madness
[V] Oh no, oh no, it won't stop

[C] Say, "Don't go"
[C] I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"
[C] Why'd you have to lead me on?
[C] Why'd you have to twist the knife?
[C] Walk away and leave me bleedin', bleedin'?
[C] Why'd you whisper in the dark
[C] Just to leave me in the night?
[C] Now your silence has me screamin', screamin'

[V] You went to a party
[V] I heard from everybody
[V] You part the crowd like the Red-Sea
[V] Don't even get me started
[V] Did you get anxious though
[V] On the way home?
[V] I guess I'll never, ever know
[V] Now that we don't talk
[V] You grew your hair long
[V] You got new icons
[V] And from the outside
[V] It looks like you're tryin' lives on
[V] I miss the old ways
[V] You didn't have to change
[V] But I guess I don't have a say
[V] Now that we don't talk
[C] I call my mom, she said that it was for the best
[C] Remind myself, the more I gave, you'd want me less
[C] I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost
[C] And what it cost, now that we don't talk
[B] What do you tell your friends we
[B] Shared dinners, long weekends with?
[B] Truth is, I can't pretend it's
[B] Platonic, it's just ended, so
[C] I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)
[C] Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left (Until I left)
[C] I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (Of what I lost)
[C] And what it cost, now that we don't talk
[I] I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
[I] Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht
[I] With important men who think important thoughts
[I] Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk
[I] And the only way back to my dignity
[I] Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
[I] Just like I had been when you were chasing me
[I] Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk

[V] You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
[V] In my peripheral vision
[V] I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
[V] All was quickly forgiven
[V] You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
[V] Flush with the currency of cool
[V] I was always turnin' out my empty pockets
[V] And when it came to you
[C] I didn't come here to make friends
[C] We were born to be suburban legends
[C] When you hold me, it holds me together
[C] And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
[V] I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
[V] Would surprise the whole school
[V] When I ended up back at our class reunion
[V] Walkin' in with you
[V] You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
[V] With the pages ripped out
[V] I am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium
[V] And I can still see you now
[C] I didn't come here to make friends
[C] We were born to be suburban legends
[C] When you hold me, it holds me together
[C] And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever
[C] I know that you still remember
[C] We were born to be national treasures
[C] When you told me we'd get back together
[C] And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

[B] And I'm, like, I'm just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
[B] Like, we are never getting back together
[B] Like, ever (No)
[C] We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
[C] We are never, ever, ever (Oh) gettin' back together
[C] You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (To me)
[C] But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together
[I] We (Ooh), no
[I] Gettin' back together (Ooh)
[I] We (Ooh), oh
[I] Gettin' back together (Ooh), yeah
[I] You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
[I] But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together

[V] I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
[V] I threw my phone across the room at you
[V] I was expecting some dramatic turn away
[V] But you stayed
[V] This morning, I said we should talk about it
[V] 'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
[V] That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
[V] And said, "Okay, let's talk"
[C] And I said, "Stay, stay, stay"
[C] I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
[C] You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
[C] But I think that it's best if we both stay
[V] Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
[V] Who took all of their problems out on me
[V] But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
[V] And I love you because you have given me
[C] No choice but to stay, stay, stay
[C] I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
[C] You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
[C] But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay
[B] You took the time to memorize me
[B] My fears, my hopes and dreams
[B] I just like hanging out with you
[B] All the time
[B] All those times that you didn't leave
[B] It's been occurring to me
[B] I'd like to hang out with you
[B] For my whole life
[C] Stay
[C] And I'll be loving you for quite some time
[C] No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
[C] So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
[C] Stay, stay, stay
[C] I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
[C] You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
[C] But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
[C] Stay, stay, stay
[C] I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
[C] You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
[C] But I think that it's best if we both stay
[I] That's so fun

[V] I find myself at your door
[V] Just like all those times before
[V] I'm not sure how I got there
[V] All roads, they lead me here
[V] I imagine you are home
[V] In your room, all alone
[V] And you open your eyes into mine
[V] And everything feels better
[C] And right before your eyes
[C] I'm breakin'
[C] No past, no reasons why
[C] Just you and me
[C] This is the last time I'm askin' you this
[C] Put my name at the top of your list
[C] This is the last time I'm askin' you why
[C] You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye
[V] You find yourself at my door
[V] And just like all those times before
[V] You wear your best apology
[V] But I was there to watch you leave
[V] And all the times I let you in
[V] Just for you to go again
[V] Disappear when you come back
[V] Everything is better
[C] And right before your eyes
[C] I'm achin'
[C] No past, nowhere to hide
[C] Just you and me
[C] This is the last time I'm askin' you this
[C] Put my name at the top of your list
[C] This is the last time I'm askin' you why
[C] You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye
[B] This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
[B] This is the last time I say, "It's been you all along"
[B] This is the last time I let you in my door
[B] This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
[B] Oh, oh, oh, oh
[B] Oh, oh, oh, oh
[C] This is the last time I'm askin' you this
[C] Put my name at the top of your list
[C] This is the last time I'm askin' you why
[C] You break my heart in the blink of an eye
[C] This is the last time I'm askin' you this (This is the last time I'm askin' you this)
[C] Put my name at the top of your list (Put my name at the top of your list)
[C] This is the last time I'm askin' you why (This is the last time I'm askin' you why)
[C] You break my heart in the blink of an eye (You break my heart)
[I] This is the last time I'm askin' you, last time I'm askin' you
[I] Last time I'm askin' you this
[I] This is the last time I'm askin' you, last time I'm askin' you
[I] Last time I'm askin' you this
[I] This is the last time I'm askin' you, last time I'm askin' you
[I] Last time I'm askin' you this
[I] This is the last time I'm askin' you, last time I'm askin' you
[I] Last time I'm askin' you this

[V] I was reminiscing just the other day
[V] While havin' coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
[V] Back to a first-glance feelin' on New-York time
[V] Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
[V] Took off faster than a green light, go
[V] Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
[V] I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
[V] And that was the first day
[C] And darlin', it was good
[C] Never lookin' down
[C] And right there where we stood
[C] Was holy ground
[V] Spinnin' like a girl in a brand new dress
[V] We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
[V] We block the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
[V] And for the first time, I had something to lose
[V] And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
[V] And the story's got dust on every page
[V] But, sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
[V] And I see your face in every crowd
[C] 'Cause, darlin', it was good (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
[C] Never lookin' down (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
[C] And right there where we stood (Ooh-ayy)
[C] Was holy ground
[C] Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
[C] Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
[B] Tonight, I'm gonna dance
[B] For all that we've been through
[B] But I don't wanna dance
[B] If I'm not dancin' with you
[B] Tonight, I'm gonna dance
[B] Like you were in this room
[B] But I don't wanna dance
[B] If I'm not dancin' with you
[C] It was good
[C] I'm never lookin' down
[C] And right there where we stood
[C] Was holy ground
[C] Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
[C] Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
[I] Tonight, I'm gonna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
[I] For all that we've been through (Ooh-ayy, oh-woah)
[I] But I don't wanna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
[I] If I'm not dancin' with you (Ooh-ayy, oh-woah)
[I] Tonight, I'm gonna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
[I] Like you were in this room (Ooh-ayy, oh-woah)
[I] But I don't wanna dance (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
[I] If I'm not dancin' with you

[V] Long handwritten notes deep in your pocket
[V] Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
[V] I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
[V] Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait
[C] We had a beautiful, magic love there
[C] What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
[V] In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
[V] And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities
[V] And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
[V] And you've got your demons and, darlin', they all look like me
[C] 'Cause we had a beautiful, magic love there
[C] What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
[C] Woah, woah, woah, oh
[B] Distance, timin', breakdown, fighting
[B] Silence, the train runs off its tracks
[B] Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
[B] Hang up, give up and, for the life of us, we can't get back
[C] A beautiful, magic love there
[C] What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
[C] What we had, a beautiful, magic love there
[C] What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
[C] We had a beautiful, magic love there
[C] What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[V] New to town with a made-up name
[V] In the angel's city, chasin' fortune and fame
[V] And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
[V] You had it figured out since you were in school
[V] Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
[V] So overnight, you look like a '60s queen
[C] Another name goes up in lights
[C] Like diamonds in the sky
[C] And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
[C] Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
[C] But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
[C] Oh, oh, oh
[V] And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
[V] And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
[V] And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
[V] And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
[V] 'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
[V] And all the young things line up to take your place
[C] Another name goes up in lights
[C] You wonder if you'll make it out alive
[C] And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
[C] Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
[C] Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
[C] Oh, oh, oh
[C] Oh, oh, oh
[V] It was a few years later, I showed up here
[V] And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
[V] How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out
[V] They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
[V] Chose the rose garden over Madison-Square
[V] And it took some time, but I understand it now
[C] 'Cause now my name is up in lights
[C] But I think you got it right
[C] Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
[C] Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
[C] Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
[C] Oh, oh, oh
[C] Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
[C] Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
[C] Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
[C] Oh, oh, oh
[C] Oh, oh-woah, oh

[I] You good to go?
[V] All I knew this mornin' when I woke
[V] Is I know something now
[V] Know something now I didn't before
[V] And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
[V] Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
[V] In the back of my mind makin' me feel like
[C] I just wanna know you better
[C] Know you better, know you better now
[C] I just wanna know you better
[C] Know you better, know you better now
[C] I just wanna know you better
[C] Know you better, know you better now
[C] I just wanna know you
[C] Know you, know you
[C] 'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
[C] And your eyes look like comin' home
[C] All I know is a simple name
[C] Everything has changed
[C] All I know is you held the door
[C] You'll be mine and I'll be yours
[C] All I know since yesterday, yeah
[C] Is everything has changed
[V] And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
[V] But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
[V] And open up the door for you
[V] And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
[V] The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
[V] Takin' flight, makin' me feel like
[C] I just wanna know you better
[C] Know you better, know you better now
[C] I just wanna know you better
[C] Know you better, know you better now

[B] And meet me there tonight
[B] And let me know that it's not all in my mind-ind-ind
[C] I just wanna know you better
[C] Know you better, know you better now

[I] All I know is a new found grace
[I] All my days, I'll know your face
[I] All I know since yesterday, yeah
[I] Is everything has changed

[C] I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
[C] It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
[C] The whole place was dressed to the nines
[C] And we were dancin', dancin'
[C] Like we're made of starlight
[C] Like we're made of starlight
[V] I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
[V] Picks me up late one night, out the window
[V] We were seventeen and crazy, runnin' wild, wild
[V] Can't remember what song it was playin' when we walked in
[V] The night we snuck into a yacht club party
[V] Pretendin' to be a duchess and a prince
[C] And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
[C] It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
[C] The whole place was dressed to the nines
[C] And we were dancin', dancin'
[C] Like we're made of starlight, starlight
[C] Like we're made of starlight, starlight
[V] He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change"
[V] "You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinkin' that way"
[V] He was tryin' to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
[V] "Don't you see the starlight, starlight?"
[V] "Don't you dream impossible things?"
[C] Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
[C] It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
[C] The whole place was dressed to the nines
[C] And we were dancin', dancin'
[C] Like we're made of starlight, starlight
[C] Like we're made of starlight, starlight
[B] Ooh, ooh, he's talkin' crazy
[B] Ooh, ooh, dancin' with me
[B] Ooh, ooh, we could get married
[B] Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream
[C] (Ooh-hoo-hoo)
[C] (Ooh-hoo-hoo)
[C] (Ooh-hoo-hoo)
[C] (Ooh-hoo-hoo)
[C] Oh my, what a marvelous tune
[C] It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
[C] The whole place was dressed to the nines
[C] And we were dancin', dancin'
[C] Like we're made of starlight, starlight
[C] Like we're made of starlight, starlight
[I] Like we're made of starlight, starlight
[I] Like we dream impossible dreams
[I] Like starlight, starlight
[I] Like we dream impossible dreams
[I] Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
[I] Don't you dream impossible things?

[V] Took a deep breath in the mirror
[V] He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
[V] Turn the lock and put my headphones on
[V] He always said he didn't get this song, but I do, I do
[V] I walked in, expectin' you'd be late
[V] But you got here early and you stand and wave, I walk to you
[V] You pull my chair out and help me in
[V] And you don't know how nice that is, but I do
[C] And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
[C] I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
[C] I've been spendin' the last eight months
[C] Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
[C] But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
[V] You said you never met one girl who
[V] Had as many James-Taylor records as you, but I do
[V] We tell stories and you don't know why
[V] I'm comin' off a little shy, but I do
[C] But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
[C] I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
[C] I've been spendin' the last eight months
[C] Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
[C] But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
[B] And we walked down the block to my car
[B] And I almost brought him up
[B] But you start to talk about the movies
[B] That your family watches every single Christmas
[B] And I wanna talk about that
[B] And for the first time, what's past is past
[C] 'Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
[C] I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
[C] I've been spendin' the last eight months
[C] Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
[C] But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
[I] On a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[V] You should've been there
[V] Should've burst through the door
[V] With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
[V] And it would've felt like
[V] A million little shining stars that just align
[V] And I would've been so happy
[V] Christmas lights glisten
[V] I've got my eye on the door
[V] Just waitin' for you to walk in
[V] But the time is tickin'
[V] People ask me how I've been
[V] As I comb back through my memory
[V] How you said you'd be here
[V] You said you'd be here
[C] And it was like slow motion
[C] Standing there in my party dress
[C] In red lipstick
[C] With no one to impress
[C] And they're all laughin'
[C] As I'm lookin' around the room
[C] But there was one thing missin'
[C] And that was the moment I knew
[V] And the hours pass by
[V] Now I just wanna be alone
[V] But your close friends always seem to know
[V] When there's somethin' really wrong
[V] So they follow me down the hall
[V] And there in the bathroom
[V] I try not to fall apart
[V] And the sinking feelin' starts
[V] As I say hopelessly
[V] "He said he'd be here"
[C] And it was like slow motion
[C] Standing there in my party dress
[C] In red lipstick
[C] With no one to impress
[C] And they're all laughin'
[C] And asking me about you
[C] But there was one thing missin'
[C] And that was the moment I knew
[B] What do you say
[B] When tears are streaming down your face
[B] In front of everyone you know?
[B] And what do you do
[B] When the one who means the most to you
[B] Is the one who didn't show?
[B] You should've been here
[B] And I would've been so happy
[C] And it was like slow motion
[C] Standing there in my party dress
[C] In red lipstick
[C] With no one to impress
[C] And they're all standin' around me, singin'
[C] "Happy birthday to you"
[C] But there was one thing missin'
[C] And that was the moment I knew
[C] (Oh) Oh, I knew
[C] (Oh)
[I] You called me later
[I] And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
[I] And I said, "I'm sorry too"
[I] And that was the moment I knew

[V] You said it in a simple way
[V] 4AM, the second day
[V] How strange that I don't know you at all
[V] Stumbled through the long goodbye
[V] One last kiss, then catch your flight
[V] Right when I was just about to fall
[C] I told myself, "Don't get attached"
[C] But in my mind, I play it back
[C] Spinning faster than the plane that took you
[C] And this is when the feelin' sinks in
[C] I don't wanna miss you like this
[C] Come back, be here
[C] Come back, be here
[C] I guess you're in New-York today
[C] I don't wanna need you this way
[C] Come back, be here
[C] Come back, be here
[V] The delicate beginnin' rush
[V] The feelin' you can know so much
[V] Without knowing anything at all
[V] And now that I can put this down
[V] If I had known what I know now
[V] I never would've played so nonchalant
[C] Taxi cabs and busy streets
[C] That never bring you back to me
[C] I can't help but wish you took me with you
[C] And this is when the feelin' sinks in
[C] I don't wanna miss you like this
[C] Come back, be here
[C] Come back, be here
[C] I guess you're in London today
[C] And I don't wanna need you this way
[C] Come back, be here
[C] Come back, be here
[C] Oh, oh
[C] Oh, oh
[C] Oh, oh
[B] This is falling in love in the cruelest way
[B] This is fallin' for you when you are worlds away
[B] In New-York, be here
[B] But you're in London and I break down
[B] 'Cause it's not fair that you're not around
[C] This is when the feelin' sinks in
[C] I don't wanna miss you like this
[C] Come back, be here
[C] Come back, be here
[C] I guess you're in New-York today
[C] And I don't wanna need you this way
[C] Come back, be here
[C] Come back, be here
[C] Oh, oh
[C] I don't wanna miss you like this
[C] Oh, oh
[I] Come back, be here
[I] Come back, be here

[I] Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
[I] And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
[I] Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
[I] And everybody knows that
[V] I don't even know her
[V] But I feel a responsibility
[V] To do what's upstanding and right
[V] It's kinda like a code, yeah
[V] And you've been getting closer and closer
[V] And crossing so many lines
[C] And it would be a fine proposition
[C] If I was a stupid girl
[C] But, honey, I am no one's exception
[C] This, I have previously learned
[C] So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
[C] And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
[C] Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
[C] And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
[C] I see you turn off your phone
[C] And now you've got me alone, and I say
[C] Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
[C] And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
[V] I just wanna make sure
[V] You understand perfectly
[V] You're the kind of man who makes me sad
[V] While she waits up
[V] You chase down the newest thing
[V] And take for granted what you have
[C] And it would be a fine proposition
[C] If I was a stupid girl
[C] And, yeah, I might go with it
[C] If I hadn't once been just like her
[C] So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
[C] And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
[C] Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
[C] And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
[C] I see you turn off your phone
[C] And now you've got me alone, and I say
[C] Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
[C] And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
[C] Oh-oh
[C] Oh-oh
[B] Call a cab, lose my number
[B] You're about to lose your girl
[B] Call a cab, lose my number
[B] Let's consider this lesson learned
[C] Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
[C] And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
[C] Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
[C] And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
[C] Wanna see you pick up your phone
[C] And tell her you're coming home
[C] Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
[C] And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
[I] It would be a fine proposition
[I] If I hadn't once been just like her

[V] I remember your bare feet down the hallway
[V] I remember your little laugh
[V] Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
[V] I love you to the moon and back
[V] I remember your blue eyes lookin' into mine
[V] Like we had our own secret club
[V] I remember you dancin' before bedtime
[V] Then jumpin' on me, waking me up
[V] I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
[V] And even the moment I knew
[V] You fought it hard like an army guy
[V] Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
[C] "Come on, baby, with me
[C] We're gonna fly away from here
[C] You were my best four years"
[V] I remember the drive home when the blind hope
[V] Turned to cryin' and screamin', "Why?"
[V] Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
[V] About a beautiful boy who died
[V] And it's about to be Halloween, you could be anything
[V] You wanted if you were still here
[V] I remember the last day when I kissed your face
[V] And whispered in your ear
[C] "Come on, baby, with me
[C] We're gonna fly away from here
[C] Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
[C] We'll just disappear
[C] Come on, baby, with me
[C] We're gonna fly away from here
[C] You were my best four years"
[B] What if I'm standin' in your closet trying to talk to you?
[B] And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
[B] And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
[B] And what if the miracle was even gettin' one moment with you?
[C] Come on, baby, with me
[C] We're gonna fly away from here
[C] Come on, baby, with me
[C] We're gonna fly away from here
[C] You were my best four years
[I] I remember your bare feet down the hallway
[I] I love you to the moon and back

[V] I know I'm probably better off on my own
[V] Than lovin' a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
[V] And I see the permanent damage you did to me
[V] Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
[C] I wish it wasn't 4AM, standin' in the mirror
[C] Saying to myself, "You know you had to do it"
[C] I know the bravest thing I ever did was run
[C] Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
[C] But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
[C] I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
[C] But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
[C] A better man
[V] I know I'm probably better off all alone
[V] Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
[V] And it was always on your terms, I waited on every careless word
[V] Hoping they might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning
[C] But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
[C] Talking down to me like I'd always be around
[C] Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
[C] Oh, you never thought I'd run
[C] Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
[C] But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
[C] I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
[C] But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
[C] A better man
[B] I hold onto this pride because, these days, it's all I have
[B] And I gave to you my best
[B] And we both know you can't say that
[B] I wish you were a better man
[B] I wonder what we would've become if you were a better man
[B] We might still be in love if you were a better man
[B] You would've been the one if you were a better man
[C] Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
[C] But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
[C] I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
[C] But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
[C] A better man
[C] (Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
[C] We might still be in love, if you were a better man
[C] (But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
[C] I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
[C] But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
[C] A better man
[I] We might still be in love if you were a better man
[I] You would've been the one if you were a better man

[V] They tell you while you're young
[V] "Girls, go out and have your fun"
[V] Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
[V] Criticize the way you fly
[V] When you're soaring through the sky
[V] Shoot you down and then they sigh
[V] And say, "She looks like she's been through it"
[C] Lord, what will become of me
[C] Once I've lost my novelty?
[C] I've had too much to drink tonight
[C] And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
[C] And I wake up in the middle of the night
[C] It's like I can feel time moving
[C] How can a person know everythin' at eighteen
[C] But nothin' at twenty-two?
[C] And will you still want me
[C] When I'm nothing new?
[V] How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
[V] When you can't blame it on my youth
[V] And roll your eyes with affection
[V] And my cheeks are growing tired
[V] From turning red and faking smiles
[V] Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?
[C] And someone else lights up the room (Ah)
[C] People love an ingénue (Ah)
[C] I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
[C] How did I go from growin' up to breaking down?
[C] And I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
[C] It's like I can feel time movin'
[C] How can a person know everything at eighteen
[C] But nothing at twenty-two?
[C] And will you still want me
[C] When I'm nothing new?
[B] I know someday I'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream
[B] The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
[B] She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
[B] I'll say I'm happy for her, then I'll cry myself to sleep
[B] Oh, woah, oh (Oh)
[B] Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh (Oh)
[C] I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
[C] But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
[C] I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
[C] And I can feel time moving
[C] How can a person know everything at eighteen
[C] But nothing at twenty-two?
[C] And will you still want me
[C] Will you still want me
[C] Will you still want me
[C] When I'm nothing new?

[I] What about your promises, promises?
[I] What about your promises, promises, promises? No
[V] What a shame
[V] Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
[V] Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
[V] That you never should have made
[C] I'm here on the kitchen floor
[C] You call, but I won't hear it
[C] You said, "No one else"
[C] How could you do this, babe?
[C] (What about your promises, promises?)
[C] You really blew this, babe
[C] We ain't getting through this one, babe

[C] (This is the last time, this is the last time)
[C] This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
[C] (What about your promises, promises, promises? No)
[V] What a waste
[V] Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
[V] And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
[V] Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe
[C] I break down every time you call
[C] We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
[C] We said, "No one else"
[C] How could you do this, babe?
[C] (Oh, what about your promises, promises?)
[C] You really blew this, babe
[C] We ain't getting through this one, babe
[C] This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
[C] (This is the last time, this is the last time)
[C] This is the last time I'll ever call you
[B] Since you admitted it (Oh-oh), I keep picturin' (Oh-oh)
[B] Her lips on your neck (Oh-oh), I can't unsee it
[B] I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe
[B] What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
[B] How could you do this, babe? (Babe)

[I] You said, "No one else"

[I] I break down every time you call
[I] We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
[I] We said, "No one else"
[I] This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (Babe)
[I] (What about your promises, promises?)

[V] I know that you like me
[V] And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
[V] And I became hypnotized
[V] By freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied
[C] But now, you're so far away and I'm down
[C] Feelin' like a face in the crowd
[C] I'm reachin' for you, terrified
[C] 'Cause you could be the one that I love
[C] I could be the one that you dream of
[C] A message in a bottle is all I can do
[C] Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
[C] You could be the one that I keep, and I
[C] I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
[C] A message in a bottle is all I can do
[C] Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
[V] These days I'm restless
[V] Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
[V] But time moves faster
[V] Replayin' your laughter, disaster
[C] 'Cause now, you're so far away and I'm down
[C] Feelin' like a face in the crowd
[C] I'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause
[C] 'Cause you could be the one that I love

[C] A message in a bottle is all I can do
[C] Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)
[C] You could be the one that I keep, and I (Ah)
[C] I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (At)
[C] A message in a bottle is all I can do
[C] Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
[B] How is it in London? (London)
[B] Where were you while I'm wonderin' (Wonderin')
[B] If I'll ever see you again?
[B] You could be the one that I love, mm-mm
[B] And now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

[V] 3AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
[V] Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
[V] And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
[V] And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh
[V] Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
[V] Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
[V] Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
[V] And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of
[C] But now that we're done and it's over
[C] I bet you couldn't believe
[C] When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
[C] And I bet you think about me
[V] You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
[V] Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly-Hills
[V] I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
[V] Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills
[V] But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
[V] And you and I fell like an early spring snow
[V] But reality crept in, you said we're too different
[V] You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes
[C] Mr. Superior Thinkin'
[C] Do you have all the space that you need?
[C] I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
[C] And I bet you think about me
[C] I bet you think about me, yes
[C] I bet you think about me
[B] Oh, block it all out
[B] The voices so loud, sayin'
[B] "Why did you let her go?"
[B] Does it make you feel sad
[B] That the love that you're lookin' for
[B] Is the love that you had?
[V] Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
[V] Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
[V] Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
[V] Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me
[C] But now that we're done and it's over
[C] I bet it's hard to believe
[C] But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
[C] And, yeah, I bet you think about me
[C] I bet you think about me, yes
[C] I bet you think about me
[I] I bet you think about me when you're out
[I] At your cool indie music concerts every week
[I] I bet you think about me in your house
[I] With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
[I] I bet you think about me when you say
[I] "Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me"
[I] I bet you think about me

[V] He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
[V] He says, "Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?"
[V] He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
[V] He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
[C] I call, just checkin' up on him
[C] He's up, 3AM, pacin'
[C] He says, "It's not just a phase I'm in"
[C] My voice comes out beggin'
[C] All this time, I didn't know
[C] You were breakin' down
[C] I'd fall to pieces on the floor
[C] If you weren't around
[C] Too young to know it gets better
[C] I'll be summer sun for you forever
[C] Forever winter if you go
[V] He seems fine most of the time, forcing smiles and never minds
[V] His laugh is a symphony, when the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
[V] I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
[V] Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead
[C] I call, just checkin' up on him
[C] He's up, 5AM, wasted
[C] Long gone, not even listening
[C] My voice comes out screamin'
[C] All this time, I didn't know
[C] You were breakin' down
[C] I'd fall to pieces on the floor
[C] If you weren't around
[C] Too young to know it gets better
[C] I'll be summer sun for you forever
[C] Forever winter if you go
[B] If I was standing there in your apartment
[B] I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
[B] I'd say, "I love you even at your darkest and
[B] Please, don't go"
[C] I didn't know
[C] You were breakin' down
[C] I'd fall to pieces on the floor
[C] If you weren't around
[C] Too young to know it gets better
[C] I'll be summer sun for you forever
[C] Forever winter if you go
[C] (Ooh, ooh, ooh)
[C] I'll be your summer sun forever
[C] (Ooh, ooh, ooh) At 3AM, pacin'
[C] All this time, I didn't know
[C] (Ooh, ooh, ooh) At 5AM, wasted
[C] I'd be in pieces on the floor
[C] Forever winter if you go
[I] He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
[I] I say, "Believe in one thing, I won't go away"

[I] One, two, three, four
[V] Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
[V] We shouldn't be in this town
[V] And my so-called friends, they don't know
[V] I'd drive away before I let you go
[V] So give me a reason and don't say no, no
[C] There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote
[C] "I'll wait for you"
[C] There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
[C] Take it with you
[C] And run like you'd run from the law
[C] Darling, let's run
[C] Run from it all
[C] We can go where our eyes can take us
[C] Go where no one else is, run
[C] Ooh, we'll run
[C] Ooh, we'll run
[C] Ooh, we'll run
[V] So you laugh like a child
[V] And I'll sing like no one cares
[V] No one to be and no one to tell
[V] I could see this view a hundred times
[V] Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
[V] So give me a reason and don't say no, no
[C] And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
[C] Since I gave it to you
[C] There's a heart on your sleeve, I'll take it when I leave
[C] And hold it for you
[C] And run like you'd run from the law
[C] Darling, let's run
[C] Run from it all
[C] We can go like they're trying to chase us
[C] Go where no one else is, run
[C] Ooh, we'll run
[C] Ooh, we'll run
[C] Ooh, we'll run
[B] There's been this hole in my heart
[B] This thing was a shot in the dark
[B] Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart
[B] And I'll hold onto you while we run
[B] (And we run and we run and we run)
[C] Like you'd run from the law
[C] (And we run and we run and we run)
[C] Darling, let's run
[C] (And we run and we run and we run)
[C] Run from it all
[C] (And we run and we run and we run)
[C] We can go where our eyes can take us
[C] Go where no one else is, run
[C] Ooh, we'll run
[C] Ooh, we'll run
[C] Ooh, we'll run
[C] Ooh, and we'll run

[C] I wish I could fly
[C] I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
[C] I'd write this in the sky
[C] I miss you like it was the very first night
[V] And so it goes
[V] Every weekend, this same party
[V] I never go alone
[V] And I don't seem broken-hearted
[V] My friends all say they know
[V] Everything I'm going through
[V] I drive down different roads
[V] But they all lead back to you
[C] 'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
[C] They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
[C] Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
[C] They don't know how much I miss you
[C] I wish I could fly
[C] I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
[C] I'd write this in the sky
[C] I miss you like it was the very first night
[V] And so it was
[V] We never saw it comin'
[V] Not trying to fall in love
[V] But we did like children runnin'
[V] Back then, we didn't know
[V] We were built to fall apart
[V] We broke the status-quo
[V] Then we broke each other's hearts
[C] But don't forget about the night out in L.A.
[C] Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway
[C] No one knows about the words that we whispered
[C] No one knows how much I miss you
[C] I wish I could fly
[C] I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
[C] I'd write this in the sky
[C] I miss you like it was the very first night
[C] Take me away, take me away
[C] Take me away to you, to you
[C] Take me away, take me away
[C] Take me away to you, to you
[B] I remember the night at the hotel
[B] I was ridin' in the car when we both fell
[B] I'm the one on the phone as you whisper
[B] "Do you know how much I miss you?"
[B] I wish that we could go back in time
[B] And I'd say to you
[B] "I miss you like it was the very first night"
[C] I wish I could fly
[C] I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
[C] I'd write this in the sky
[C] I miss you like it was the very first night
[C] Take me away (Take me), take me away (Take me)
[C] Take me away (Take me) to you, to you
[C] Take me away (Take me), take me away (Take me)
[C] Take me away (Take me) to you, to you

[V] I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
[V] But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
[V] And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
[V] And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
[V] Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
[V] We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
[V] Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
[V] And I can picture it after all these days
[C] And I know it's long gone and
[C] That magic's not here no more
[C] And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
[C] Oh, oh, oh
[C] 'Cause there we are again on that little town street
[C] You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
[C] Wind in my hair, I was there
[C] I remember it all too well
[V] Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
[V] You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
[V] And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
[V] You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
[V] And you were tossing me the car keys, "Fuck the patriarchy"
[V] Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
[V] And I was thinkin' on the drive down, "Any time now
[V] He's gonna say it's love," you never called it what it was
[V] 'Til we were dead and gone and buried
[V] Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
[V] After three months in the grave
[V] And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
[V] But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
[C] And I know it's long gone and
[C] There was nothing else I could do
[C] And I forget about you long enough
[C] To forget why I needed to
[C] 'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
[C] We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
[C] Down the stairs, I was there
[C] I remember it all too well
[C] And there we are again when nobody had to know
[C] You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
[C] Sacred prayer and we'd swear
[C] To remember it all too well, yeah
[B] Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
[B] But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
[B] Runnin' scared, I was there
[B] I remember it all too well
[B] And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
[B] So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
[B] I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
[B] 'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[V] They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
[V] Every time you double-cross my mind
[V] You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
[V] And that made me want to die
[V] The idea you had of me, who was she?
[V] A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
[V] Not weepin' in a party bathroom
[V] Some actress askin' me what happened, you
[V] That's what happened, you
[V] You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
[V] Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
[V] But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
[V] And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"
[V] Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
[V] I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
[V] After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
[V] Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
[V] But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
[V] 'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
[V] You can't get rid of it
[V] 'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
[C] 'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
[C] Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
[C] It was rare, I was there
[C] I remember it all too well
[C] Wind in my hair, you were there
[C] You remember it all
[C] Down the stairs, you were there
[C] You remember it all
[C] It was rare, I was there
[C] I remember it all too well
[V] And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
[V] "I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age"
[V] From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
[V] I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
[V] And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
[V] Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
[V] 'Cause in this city's barren cold
[V] I still remember the first fall of snow
[V] And how it glistened as it fell
[V] I remember it all too well
[I] Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
[I] Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
[I] Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
[I] Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
[I] Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
[I] Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
[I] It was rare, you remember it all too well

[I] Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
[I] It was rare, you remember it
[I] Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
[I] Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
[I] Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
[I] It was rare, you remember it

[C] You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
[C] You are the best thing that's ever been mine
[V] Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
[V] And there's a drawer of my things at your place
[V] You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
[V] You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
[C] But we got bills to pay
[C] We got nothing figured out
[C] When it was hard to take
[C] Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
[C] Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
[C] You put your arm around me for the first time
[C] You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
[C] You are the best thing that's ever been mine
[C] Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
[C] You saw me start to believe for the first time
[C] You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
[C] You are the best thing that's ever been mine
[C] Oh-oh, oh
[B] And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
[B] As everything was slipping right out of our hands
[B] I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
[B] Braced myself for the goodbye
[B] 'Cause it's all I've ever known
[B] Then you took me by surprise
[B] You said, "I'll never leave you alone" (Oh)
[C] You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water
[C] And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
[C] I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
[C] She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
[C] Hold on, make it last
[C] Hold on, never turn back
[C] (Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
[C] (Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine
[I] Do you believe it? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[I] We're gonna make it now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
[I] And I can see it (Yeah, yeah)
[I] I can see it now

[V] The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
[V] And I'm a house of cards
[V] You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
[V] But I kinda know that I won't get far
[V] And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
[V] Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of
[C] Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
[C] Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
[C] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[C] Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
[C] Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
[C] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[V] My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
[V] You touch me once and it's really somethin'
[V] You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
[V] I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
[V] But with you, I know it's no good
[V] And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would
[C] Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
[C] Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
[C] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[C] Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
[C] Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
[C] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[B] I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
[B] Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me
[B] It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
[B] And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
[B] I'm captivated by you, baby, like a fireworks show
[C] Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
[C] Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain
[C] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[C] Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
[C] Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
[C] 'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
[I] And the sparks fly
[I] Oh, baby, smile
[I] And the sparks fly

[V] I'm so glad you made time to see me
[V] How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
[V] I haven't seen them in a while
[V] You've been good, busier than ever
[V] We small talk, work and the weather
[V] Your guard is up and I know why
[C] Because the last time you saw me
[C] Is still burned in the back of your mind
[C] You gave me roses and I left them there to die
[C] So, this is me swallowing my pride
[C] Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
[C] And I go back to December all the time
[C] It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
[C] Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
[C] I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
[C] I go back to December all the time
[V] These days, I haven't been sleeping
[V] Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
[V] When your birthday passed and I didn't call
[V] Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
[V] I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
[V] And realized I loved you in the fall
[C] And then the cold came, the dark days
[C] When fear crept into my mind
[C] You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
[C] So, this is me swallowing my pride
[C] Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
[C] And I go back to December all the time
[C] It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
[C] Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
[C] I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
[C] I go back to December all the time
[B] I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
[B] So good to me, so right
[B] And how you held me in your arms that September night
[B] The first time you ever saw me cry
[B] Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
[B] Probably mindless dreaming
[B] But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
[B] I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
[B] So, if the chain is on your door, I understand
[C] But this is me swallowing my pride
[C] Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
[C] And I go back to December
[C] It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
[C] Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
[C] I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
[C] I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
[C] I go back to December all the time
[I] All the time

[V] I am not the kind of girl
[V] Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
[V] But you are not the kind of boy
[V] Who should be marrying the wrong girl
[V] I sneak in and see your friends
[V] And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
[V] And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
[V] Somewhere back inside a room
[V] Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry
[C] This is surely not what you thought it would be
[C] I lose myself in a daydream
[C] Where I stand and say
[C] Don't say yes, run away now
[C] I'll meet you when you're out
[C] Of the church, at the back door
[C] Don't wait or say a single vow
[C] You need to hear me out
[C] And they said, "Speak now"
[V] Fond gestures are exchanged
[V] And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
[V] And I am hiding in the curtains
[V] It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
[C] She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
[C] But I know you wish it was me
[C] You wish it was me, don't you?
[C] Don't say yes, run away now
[C] I'll meet you when you're out
[C] Of the church, at the back door
[C] Don't wait or say a single vow
[C] You need to hear me out
[C] And they said, "Speak now"
[C] Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
[C] I'll meet you when you're out
[C] Of the church, at the back door
[C] Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
[C] Your time is running out
[C] And they said, "Speak now"
[C] Ooh (Run away now), la
[C] Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh
[B] I hear the preacher say
[B] "Speak now or forever hold your peace"
[B] There's the silence, there's my last chance
[B] I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
[B] Horrified looks from everyone in the room
[B] But I'm only lookin' at you
[V] I am not the kind of girl
[V] Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
[V] But you are not the kind of boy
[V] Who should be marrying the wrong girl, ha-ha
[C] So, don't say yes, run away now
[C] I'll meet you when you're out
[C] Of the church, at the back door
[C] Don't wait or say a single vow
[C] You need to hear me out
[C] They said, "Speak now"
[C] And you say, "Let's run away now (Run away now)
[C] I'll meet you when I'm out
[C] Of my tux, at the back door
[C] Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
[C] So glad you were around
[C] When they said, 'Speak now'

[V] Long were the nights
[V] When my days once revolved around you
[V] Counting my footsteps
[V] Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
[V] And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
[V] But I swore I was fine
[V] You paint me a blue sky
[V] Then go back and turn it to rain
[V] And I lived in your chess game
[V] But you change the rules every day
[V] Wonderin' which version of you
[V] I might get on the phone tonight
[V] Well, I stopped pickin' up
[V] And this song is to let you know why
[C] Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
[C] Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
[C] The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
[C] I shoulda known
[V] Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
[V] Or maybe it's you and your sick need
[V] To give love and take it away
[V] And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
[V] Who don't understand
[V] And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
[V] "Run as fast as you can"
[C] Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
[C] Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
[C] The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
[C] Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
[C] Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by
[C] Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
[C] I shoulda known
[B] You are an expert at "Sorry" and keepin' lines blurry
[B] Never impressed by me acing your tests
[B] All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
[B] 'Cause you burned them out
[B] But I took your matches before fire could catch me
[B] So don't look now
[B] I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
[B] Oh
[C] Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
[C] Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
[C] The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
[C] I see it all now that you're gone
[C] Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
[C] The girl in the dress wrote you a song
[C] You shoulda known
[I] You shoulda known
[I] Don't you think I was too young?
[I] You shoulda known

[V] You, with your words like knives
[V] And swords and weapons that you use against me
[V] You have knocked me off my feet again
[V] Got me feelin' like a nothing
[V] You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
[V] Calling me out when I'm wounded
[V] You, pickin' on the weaker man
[C] Well, you can take me down
[C] With just one single blow
[C] But you don't know what you don't know
[C] Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
[C] And all you're ever gonna be is mean
[C] Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
[C] And all you're ever gonna be is mean
[C] Why you gotta be so mean?
[V] You, with your switching sides
[V] And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
[V] You have pointed out my flaws again
[V] As if I don't already see them
[V] I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
[V] 'Cause I'll never impress you
[V] I just wanna feel okay again
[C] I bet you got pushed around
[C] Somebody made you cold
[C] But the cycle ends right now
[C] 'Cause you can't lead me down that road
[C] And you don't know what you don't know
[C] Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
[C] And all you're ever gonna be is mean
[C] Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
[C] And all you're ever gonna be is mean
[C] Why you gotta be so mean?
[B] And I can see you years from now in a bar
[B] Talking over a football game
[B] With that same big, loud opinion, but nobody's listening
[B] Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
[B] Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
[B] But all you are is mean
[B] All you are is mean
[B] And a liar, and pathetic
[B] And alone in life, and mean
[B] And mean, and mean, and mean
[C] But someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
[C] And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
[C] Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
[C] And all you're ever gonna be is mean
[C] Why you gotta be so mean?
[C] Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
[C] (Why you gotta be so mean?)
[C] And all you're ever gonna be is mean
[C] (Why you gotta be so mean?)
[C] Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
[C] (Why you gotta be so mean?)
[C] And all you're ever gonna be is mean
[C] Why you gotta be so mean?

[V] I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
[V] How we met and the sparks flew instantly
[V] And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
[V] I used to know my place was the spot next to you
[V] Now I'm searchin' the room for an empty seat
[V] 'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
[C] Oh, a simple complication
[C] Miscommunications lead to fallout
[C] So many things that I wish you knew
[C] So many walls up, I can't break through
[C] Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
[C] And we're not speakin'
[C] And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
[C] Like it's killin' me? Yeah
[C] I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
[C] When it all broke down
[C] And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
[C] Next chapter
[V] How'd we end up this way?
[V] See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin' to look busy
[V] And you're doin' your best to avoid me
[V] I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
[V] How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here
[V] But you held your pride like you should've held me
[C] Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
[C] Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
[C] I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
[C] I've never heard silence quite this loud
[C] Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
[C] And we're not speakin'
[C] And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
[C] Like it's killin' me? Yeah
[C] I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
[C] When it all broke down
[C] And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
[B] This is looking like a contest
[B] Of who can act like they care less
[B] But I liked it better when you were on my side
[B] The battle's in your hands now
[B] But I would lay my armor down
[B] If you said you'd rather love than fight
[C] So many things that you wish I knew
[C] But the story of us might be ending soon
[C] Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
[C] And we're not speakin'
[C] And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
[C] Like it's killin' me? Yeah
[C] And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
[C] When it all broke down
[C] And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
[C] And we're not speakin'
[C] And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
[C] Like it's killin' me? Yeah
[C] I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
[C] 'Cause we're goin' down
[C] And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
[I] The end

[V] Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
[V] And it's so quiet in the world tonight
[V] Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
[V] So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight
[C] To you, everything's funny
[C] You got nothing to regret
[C] I'd give all I have, honey
[C] If you could stay like that
[C] Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
[C] Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
[C] Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
[C] Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
[C] I won't let nobody hurt you
[C] Won't let no one break your heart
[C] And no one will desert you
[C] Just try to never grow up
[C] And never grow up
[V] You're in the car, on the way to the movies
[V] And you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off
[V] At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
[V] And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
[C] But don't make her drop you off around the block
[C] Remember that she's gettin' older, too
[C] And don't lose the way that you dance around
[C] In your PJs getting ready for school
[C] Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
[C] Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
[C] Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
[C] Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
[C] And no one's ever burned you
[C] Nothing's ever left you scarred
[C] And even though you want to
[C] Just try to never grow up
[B] Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
[B] Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
[B] Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
[B] And all your little brother's favorite songs
[B] I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone
[V] So, here I am in my new apartment
[V] In a big city, they just dropped me off
[V] It's so much colder than I thought it would be
[V] So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on
[C] Wish I'd never grown up
[C] Wish I'd never grown up
[C] Oh, I don't wanna grow up
[C] Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
[C] Oh, I don't wanna grow up
[C] Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple
[C] Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
[C] Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
[C] Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
[C] Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
[C] I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)
[C] Won't let no one break your heart
[C] And even though you want to
[C] Please, try to never grow up
[I] Oh, oh (Never grow up)
[I] Just never grow up
[I] Oh (Never grow up)
[I] Just never grow up

[V] There I was again tonight
[V] Forcing laughter, faking smiles
[V] Same old tired, lonely place
[V] Walls of insincerity
[V] Shifting eyes and vacancy
[V] Vanished when I saw your face
[V] All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
[V] Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
[V] Across the room, your silhouette
[V] Starts to make its way to me
[V] The playful conversation starts
[V] Counter all your quick remarks
[V] Like passing notes in secrecy
[V] And it was enchanting to meet you
[V] All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
[C] This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
[C] I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
[C] I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
[C] I was enchanted to meet you
[V] The lingering question kept me up
[V] 2AM, who do you love?
[V] I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
[V] And now, I'm pacing back and forth
[V] Wishing you were at my door
[V] I'd open up and you would say
[V] "Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"
[V] All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
[C] This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
[C] I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
[C] I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
[C] This night is flawless, don't you let it go
[C] I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
[C] I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
[C] I was enchanted to meet you
[B] This is me praying that
[B] This was the very first page
[B] Not where the storyline ends
[B] My thoughts will echo your name
[B] Until I see you again
[B] These are the words I held back
[B] As I was leaving too soon
[B] I was enchanted to meet you
[B] Please, don't be in love with someone else
[B] Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you
[B] Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
[B] Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you (Oh-oh)
[C] This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
[C] I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
[C] I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
[C] This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
[C] Don't you let it go
[C] I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you)
[C] Dancing around all alone
[C] I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
[C] Wonderin' if you knew
[C] I was enchanted to meet you
[I] Please, don't be in love with someone else
[I] Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you

[I] Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Ha)
[I] ha-ha, time for a little revenge
[V] The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
[V] I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
[V] She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
[V] She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"
[V] I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
[V] I underestimated just who I was dealing with (Oh)
[V] She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
[V] She underestimated just who she was stealin' from
[C] She's not a saint and she's not what you think
[C] She's an actress, woah
[C] He was a moth to the flame
[C] She was holding the matches, woah
[C] Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
[C] On the playground won't make you many friends
[C] She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
[C] There is nothing I do better than revenge (Revenge), ha
[V] She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
[V] She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
[V] I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
[V] She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
[V] But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
[V] Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
[V] They didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
[V] That no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
[V] (Think about what you did)
[C] She's not a saint and she's not what you think
[C] She's an actress, woah
[C] He was a moth to the flame
[C] She was holding the matches, woah
[C] Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
[C] On the playground won't make you many friends
[C] She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
[C] There is nothing I do better than revenge (ha-ha)
[B] I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
[B] You might have him, but haven't you heard?
[B] I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
[B] You might have him, but I always get the last word
[B] Woah (Come on, can you take it back? Come on)
[C] She's not a saint and she's not what you think (No)
[C] She's an actress, woah (You know that you deserve this)
[C] He was a moth to the flame
[C] She was holding the matches, woah
[C] Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
[C] On the playground won't make you many friends
[C] She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
[C] There is nothing I do better than revenge
[I] (Come on) Do you still feel like you know what you're doin'?
[I] 'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
[I] Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
[I] I don't think you do, I don't think you do
[I] Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
[I] Come on, show me how much better you are (Oh, oh)
[I] (So much better, yeah?)
[I] So you deserve some applause
[I] 'Cause you're so much better
[I] She took him faster than you could say "Sabotage"

[V] I guess you really did it this time
[V] Left yourself in your war path
[V] Lost your balance on a tightrope
[V] Lost your mind tryin' to get it back
[C] Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
[C] Always a bigger bed to crawl into
[C] Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
[C] And everybody believed in you?
[C] It's alright, just wait and see
[C] Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
[C] Who you are is not where you've been
[C] You're still an innocent
[C] You're still an innocent
[V] Did some things you can't speak of
[V] But at night, you live it all again
[V] You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
[V] If only you had seen what you know now then
[C] Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
[C] When everything out of reach
[C] Someone bigger brought down to you
[C] Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
[C] Before the monsters caught up to you?
[C] It's alright, just wait and see
[C] Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
[C] Who you are is not where you've been
[C] You're still an innocent
[C] It's okay, life is a tough crowd
[C] Thirty-two and still growing up now
[C] Who you are is not what you did
[C] You're still an innocent
[B] Time turns flames to embers
[B] You'll have new Septembers
[B] Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
[B] Minds change like the weather
[B] I hope you remember
[B] Today is never too late to be brand new
[B] Oh, oh
[C] It's alright, just wait and see
[C] Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
[C] Who you are is not where you've been
[C] You're still an innocent
[C] It's okay, life is a tough crowd
[C] Thirty-two and still growing up now
[C] Who you are is not what you did
[C] You're still an innocent
[C] You're still an innocent
[I] Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
[I] It's never too late to get it back

[V] You and I walk a fragile line
[V] I have known it all this time
[V] But I never thought I'd live to see it break
[V] It's getting dark and it's all so quiet
[V] And I can't trust anything now
[V] And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake
[C] Oh, holding my breath
[C] Won't lose you again
[C] Something's made your eyes go cold
[C] Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
[C] I thought I had you figured out
[C] Something's gone terribly wrong
[C] You're all I wanted
[C] Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
[C] I thought I had you figured out
[C] Can't breathe whenever you're gone
[C] Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
[V] Stood there and watched you walk away
[V] From everything we had
[V] But I still mean every word I said to you
[V] He will try to take away my pain
[V] And he just might make me smile
[V] But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead
[C] Oh, holding my breath
[C] Won't see you again
[C] Something keeps me holding onto nothing
[C] Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
[C] I thought I had you figured out
[C] Something's gone terribly wrong
[C] You're all I wanted
[C] Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
[C] I thought I had you figured out
[C] Can't breathe whenever you're gone
[C] Can't turn back now, I'm haunted
[B] I know, I know
[B] I just know
[B] You're not gone
[B] You can't be gone, no
[C] Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
[C] I thought I had you figured out
[C] Something's gone terribly wrong (Terribly wrong)
[C] Won't finish what you started
[C] Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
[C] I thought I had you figured out
[C] Can't breathe whenever you're gone
[C] I can't go back, I'm haunted
[I] Oh
[I] You and I walk a fragile line
[I] I have known it all this time
[I] Never ever thought I'd see it break
[I] Never thought I'd see it

[V] I still remember the look on your face
[V] Lit through the darkness at 1:58
[V] The words that you whispered for just us to know
[V] You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
[V] Away
[V] I do recall now, the smell of the rain
[V] Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
[V] That July ninth, the beat of your heart
[V] It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms
[C] But now I'll go
[C] Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
[C] All that I know is I don't know
[C] How to be somethin' you miss
[C] I never thought we'd have a last kiss
[C] I never imagined we'd end like this
[C] Your name, forever the name on my lips
[V] I do remember the swing of your step
[V] The life of the party, you're showin' off again
[V] And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
[V] I'm not much for dancin', but for you, I did
[V] Because I love your handshake meetin' my father
[V] I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
[V] How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
[V] There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions
[C] And I'll go
[C] Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
[C] All that I know is I don't know
[C] How to be somethin' you miss
[C] I never thought we'd have a last kiss
[C] I never imagined we'd end like this
[C] Your name, forever the name on my lips, mmm
[B] So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
[B] And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
[B] And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
[B] Hope it's nice where you are
[V] And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
[V] And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
[V] You can plan for a change in the weather and time
[V] But I never planned on you changing your mind
[C] So I'll go
[C] Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
[C] All that I know is I don't know
[C] How to be somethin' you miss
[C] I never thought we'd have a last kiss
[C] I never imagined we'd end like this
[C] Your name, forever the name on my lips
[I] Just like our last kiss
[I] Forever the name on my lips
[I] Forever the name on my lips
[I] Just like our last

[V] I said, "Remember this moment"
[V] In the back of my mind
[V] The time we stood with our shaking hands
[V] The crowds in stands went wild
[V] We were the kings and the queens
[V] And they read off our names
[V] The night you danced like you knew our lives
[V] Would never be the same
[V] You held your head like a hero
[V] On a history book page
[V] It was the end of a decade
[V] But the start of an age
[C] Long live the walls we crashed through
[C] How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
[C] I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
[C] And bring on all the pretenders
[C] One day, we will be remembered
[V] I said, "Remember this feeling"
[V] I pass the pictures around
[V] Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
[V] Wishin' for right now
[V] We are the kings and the queens
[V] You traded your baseball cap for a crown
[V] When they gave us our trophies
[V] And we held them up for our town
[V] And the cynics were outraged
[V] Screaming, "This is absurd"
[V] 'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
[V] In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
[C] Long live the walls we crashed through
[C] How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
[C] I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
[C] And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
[C] Long live all the mountains we moved
[C] I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
[C] I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face"
[C] And bring on all the pretenders
[C] One day, we will be remembered
[B] Hold on to spinning around
[B] Confetti falls to the ground
[B] May these memories break our fall
[B] Will you take a moment? Promise me this
[B] That you'll stand by me forever
[B] But if, god forbid, fate should step in
[B] And force us into a goodbye
[B] If you have children some day
[B] When they point to the pictures
[B] Please, tell 'em my name
[B] Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
[B] Tell 'em how I hope they shine
[B] Long live the walls we crashed through
[B] I had the time of my life with you
[C] Long, long live the walls we crashed through
[C] How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
[C] And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
[C] And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
[C] Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved"
[C] I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
[C] And long, long live that look on your face
[C] And bring on all the pretenders
[C] One day, we will be remembered

[V] Elevator buttons and morning air
[V] Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
[V] If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
[V] But right now, my time is theirs
[V] Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
[V] They'll judge it like they know about me and you
[V] And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
[V] The jury's out, but my choice is you
[C] So don't you worry your pretty little mind
[C] People throw rocks at things that shine
[C] And life makes love look hard
[C] The stakes are high, the water's rough
[C] But this love is ours
[V] You never know what people have up their sleeves
[V] Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
[V] Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
[V] But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
[V] And you'll say
[C] Don't you worry your pretty little mind
[C] People throw rocks at things that shine
[C] And life makes love look hard
[C] The stakes are high, the water's rough
[C] But this love is ours
[B] And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
[B] Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
[B] I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
[B] 'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
[B] And I love the riddles that you speak
[B] And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
[B] Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours
[C] So don't you worry your pretty little mind
[C] People throw rocks at things that shine
[C] And life makes love look hard
[C] Don't you worry your pretty little mind
[C] People throw rocks at things that shine
[C] But they can't take what's ours
[C] They can't take what's ours
[C] The stakes are high, the water's rough
[C] But this love is ours

[V] Tall, dark, and Superman
[V] He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
[V] To save the world or go to work
[V] It's the same thing to me
[V] He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
[V] I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
[V] I hang on every word you say
[V] And you smile and say, "How are you?”
[V] And I'll say, "Just fine"
[V] I always forget to tell you, "I love you"
[V] I love you forever
[C] I watch Superman fly away
[C] You've got a busy day today
[C] Go save the world, I'll be around
[C] And I watch Superman fly away
[C] Come back, I'll be with you someday
[C] I'll be right here on the ground
[C] When you come back down
[V] Tall, dark and beautiful
[V] He's complicated, he's irrational
[V] But I hope someday you'll take me away, and save the day, yeah
[V] Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
[V] He's not all bad like his reputation
[V] And I can't hear one single word they say
[V] And you'll leave, got places to be, and I'll be okay
[V] I always forget to tell you, "I love you"
[V] I loved you from the very first day
[C] I watch Superman fly away
[C] You've got a busy day today
[C] Go save the world, I'll be around
[C] And I watch Superman fly away
[C] Come back, I'll be with you someday
[C] I'll be right here on the ground
[C] When you come back down
[B] And I watch you fly around the world
[B] And I hope you don't save some other girl
[B] Don't forget, don't forget about me
[B] I'm far away, but I never let you go
[B] I'm love-struck and looking out the window
[B] Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be
[B] Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
[B] Wishing the card was from you
[B] Wishing the call was from you
[B] 'Cause I loved you from the very first day
[C] I watch Superman fly away
[C] You've got a busy day today
[C] Go save the world, I'll be around
[C] Forever and ever
[C] And I watch Superman fly away
[C] I swear, I'll be with you someday
[C] I'll be right here on the ground
[C] When you come back down
[I] La, la, la, la, la, la
[I] La, la, la, la, la, la
[I] When you come back down

[V] Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
[V] Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
[V] Just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight
[V] I've got my money on things goin' badly
[V] Got a history of stories ending sadly
[V] Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
[V] Just one time, just one time
[C] All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
[C] Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
[C] And I want you now, wanna need you forever
[C] In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
[V] I've been left in the rain lost and pining
[V] I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying
[V] 'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)
[V] I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
[V] I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
[V] Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
[V] Just one time, just one time
[C] All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
[C] Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
[C] And I want you now, wanna need you forever
[C] In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
[B] I was thinking just one time (Just one time)
[B] Maybe the stars align (Just one time)
[B] And maybe I call you mine
[B] And you won't need space
[B] Or string me along while you decide
[B] And just one time (Just one time)
[B] Maybe the moment's right (The moment's right)
[B] It's 8:05 and I see two headlights
[C] All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
[C] Got a feelin' your electric touch (Ooh)
[C] All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
[C] Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life (Life)
[C] And I want you now, wanna need you forever
[C] In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

[V] When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor
[V] Closes the blinds and locks the door
[V] When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
[V] Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
[V] She waits and takes her time
[V] 'Cause Little-Miss-Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
[V] When Emma falls in love, I know
[V] That boy will never be the same

[V] When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
[V] Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
[V] When Emma falls in love, she disappears
[V] And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
[V] When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
[V] She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
[V] 'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
[V] She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave
[C] And she's the kind of book that you can't put down
[C] Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town

[V] You brush past me in the hallway
[V] And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
[V] I've been watchin' you for ages
[V] And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it
[C] But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
[C] What would you do if they never found us out?
[C] What would you do if we never made a sound?
[C] 'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
[C] And I could see you up against the wall with me
[C] And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
[C] That I can see you
[C] I-I-I-I
[V] And we kept everything professional
[V] But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
[V] They keep watchful eyes on us
[V] So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
[V] You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
[V] Wait 'til you see half the things that haven't happened yet
[C] But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
[C] What would you do if they never found us out?
[C] What would you do if we never made a sound?
[C] 'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
[C] And I could see you up against the wall with me
[C] And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh

[C] I could see you, make me want you even more
[C] What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
[C] That I can see you
[C] I-I-I-I
[B] I can see you in your suit and your necktie
[B] Passed me a note sayin', "Meet me tonight"
[B] Then we kiss and you know I won't ever tell, yeah
[B] And I could see you being my addiction
[B] You can see me as a secret mission
[B] Hide away and I will start behaving myself
[C] I-I-I-I
[C] Oh-oh, oh, oh
[C] I can see you waitin' down the hall from me

[I] (Once, I had an empire)
[I] (Once, I had an empire)
[V] Once, I had an empire in a golden age
[V] I was held up so high, I used to be great
[V] They used to cheer when they saw my face
[V] Now, I fear I have fallen from grace
[C] And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
[C] And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
[C] And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
[C] You don't wanna know me now
[V] Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
[V] Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
[V] Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
[V] I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart
[C] Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
[C] Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
[C] And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
[C] Falling down like promises that I never kept
[C] And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
[C] And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
[C] And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
[C] You don't wanna know me now
[B] My foes and friends watch my reign end
[B] I don't know how it could've ended this way
[B] Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
[B] People look at me like I'm a monster
[B] Now they're screamin' at the palace front gates
[B] Used to chant my name
[B] Now they're screaming that they hate me
[B] Never wanted you to hate me
[C] My castle's crumbling down
[C] And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground

[V] My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
[V] Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
[V] And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
[V] You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
[V] Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
[V] And I will block out these voices of reason in my head
[C] And the voices say, "You are not the exception
[C] You will never learn your lesson"
[C] Foolish one
[C] Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
[C] That ain't never gonna come
[C] You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
[V] You know how to keep me waitin'
[V] I know how to act like I'm fine
[V] Don't know what to call this situation
[V] But I know I can't call you mine
[V] And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
[V] 'Cause when my head is on your shoulder
[V] It starts thinkin' you'll come around
[V] And maybe, someday, when we're older
[V] This is something we'll laugh about
[V] Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news
[C] But then the voices say, "You are not the exception
[C] You will never learn your lesson"
[C] Foolish one

[C] You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
[C] Foolish one
[C] Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
[C] That ain't never gonna come
[C] You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out
[B] Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
[B] Sayin', "How could I not see the signs?"
[B] Oh, you haven't written me or called
[B] But goodbye screamin' in the silence
[B] And the voices in my head are tellin' me why
[B] 'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
[B] I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
[B] And you will say you had the best of intentions
[B] And maybe I will finally learn my lesson
[C] Foolish one
[C] Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
[C] That ain't never gonna come
[C] You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
[C] Foolish one
[C] Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
[C] That ain't never gonna come
[C] You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh
[I] La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
[I] La-la-la-la-la
[I] Ain't never gonna come
[I] Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
[I] Foolish one
[I] Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
[I] They ain't never gonna come
[I] And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
[I] Foolish one
[I] The day is gonna come for your confessions of love
[I] When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one
[I] No, he just wasn't the one

[V] Down the block, there's an antique shop
[V] And something in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in
[V] On the counter was a cardboard box
[V] And the sign said, "Photos: twenty-five cents each"
[V] Black and white, saw a 30s bride
[V] And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
[V] The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
[V] The kind you don't put down
[C] And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
[C] But in those photos, I saw us instead
[C] And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
[C] In another life, you still would've turned my head even if we'd met
[C] On a crowded street in 1944
[C] And you were headed off to fight in the war
[C] You still would've been mine
[C] We would have been timeless
[C] I would've read your love letters every single night
[C] And prayed to god you'd be comin' home all right
[C] And you would've been fine
[C] We would have been timeless
[C] 'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
[C] So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
[C] We would've been timeless
[V] I had to smile when it caught my eye
[V] There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
[V] Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
[V] And the date on the back said 1958
[V] Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
[V] Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
[V] I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
[V] At these precious things that time forgot
[C] That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
[C] Story of a romance torn apart by fate
[C] Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
[C] And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face
[C] In the 1500s, off in a foreign land
[C] And I was forced to marry another man
[C] You still would've been mine
[C] We would have been timeless
[C] I would've read your love letters every single night
[C] And run away and left it all behind
[C] You still would've been mine
[C] We would've been timeless
[C] 'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
[C] So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
[C] We would've been timeless
[B] Time breaks down your mind and body
[B] Don't you let it touch your soul
[B] It was like an age-old classic
[B] The first time that you saw me
[B] The story started when you said, "Hello"
[C] In a crowded room a few short years ago
[C] And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
[C] You're always gonna be mine
[C] We're gonna be
[C] I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
[C] We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
[C] And you'll say, "Oh my, we really were timeless"
[C] We're gonna be timeless, timeless
[C] You still would've been mine
[C] We would've been
[C] Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
[C] You still would've been mine
[C] We would've been
[I] Down the block, there's an antique shop
[I] And somethin' in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in

[V] I was supposed to be sent away
[V] But they forgot to come and get me
[V] I was a functioning alcoholic
[V] 'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
[V] All of this to say I hope you're okay
[V] But you're the reason
[V] And no one here's to blame
[V] But what about your quiet treason?
[C] And for a fortnight there, we were forever
[C] Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
[C] Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
[C] Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
[V] All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
[V] I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
[V] And I love you, it's ruining my life
[V] I love you, it's ruining my life
[V] I touched you for only a fortnight
[V] I touched you, but I touched you
[C] And for a fortnight there, we were forever
[C] Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
[C] Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
[C] Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
[C] And for a fortnight there, we were together
[C] Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
[C] Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
[C] My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him
[B] I love you, it's ruining my life
[B] I love you, it's ruining my life
[B] I touched you for only a fortnight
[B] I touched you, I touched you
[B] I love you, it's ruining my life
[B] I love you, it's ruining my life
[B] I touched you for only a fortnight
[B] I touched you, I touched you
[I] Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up
[I] 'Nother fortnight lost in America
[I] Move to Florida, buy the car you want
[I] But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me
[I] Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up
[I] 'Nother fortnight lost in America
[I] Move to Florida, buy the car you want
[I] But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you

[V] You left your typewriter at my apartment
[V] Straight from the tortured poets department
[V] I think some things I never say
[V] Like, "Who uses typewriters anyway?"
[V] But you're in self-sabotage mode
[V] Throwing spikes down on the road
[V] But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
[V] Who else decodes you?
[C] And who's gonna hold you like me?
[C] And who's gonna know you, if not me?
[C] I laughed in your face and said
[C] "You're not Dylan-Thomas, I'm not Patti-Smith
[C] This ain't the Chelsea-Hotel, we'rе modern idiots"
[C] And who's gonna hold you like me?
[C] Nobody
[C] No-fucking-body
[C] Nobody
[V] You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
[V] We declared Charlie-Puth should be a bigger artist
[V] I scratch your head, you fall asleep
[V] Like a tattooed golden retriever
[V] But you awaken with dread
[V] Pounding nails in your head
[V] But I've read this one where you come undone
[V] I chose this cyclone with you
[C] And who's gonna hold you like me?
[C] (Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
[C] And who's gonna know you like me?
[C] (Who's gonna know you?)
[C] I laughed in your face and said
[C] "You're not Dylan-Thomas, I'm not Patti-Smith
[C] This ain't the Chelsea-Hotel, we're modern idiots"
[C] And who's gonna hold you like me?
[C] (Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
[C] No-fucking-body
[C] (Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
[C] Nobody
[C] (Who's gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?)
[C] Nobody
[B] Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
[B] But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
[B] And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
[B] Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
[B] 'Cause we're crazy
[B] So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
[B] At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
[B] And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
[B] And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding
[C] Who's gonna hold you? (Who?)
[C] Me
[C] Who's gonna know you? (Who?)
[C] Me
[C] And you're not Dylan-Thomas, I'm not Patti-Smith
[C] This ain't the Chelsea-Hotel, we're two idiots
[C] Who's gonna hold you?
[C] Who's gonna hold you?
[C] Who's gonna hold you?
[C] Who's gonna hold you?
[C] Who's gonna hold you?
[C] Who's gonna hold you?
[C] Who's gonna hold you?
[C] Who's gonna hold you?
[C] Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?
[I] You left your typewriter at my apartment
[I] Straight from the tortured poets department
[I] Who else decodes you?

[V] Oh, here we go again
[V] The voices in his head
[V] Called the rain to end our days of wild
[V] The sickest army doll
[V] Purchased at the mall
[V] Rivulets descend my plastic smile
[C] But you should've seen him when he first got me
[C] My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
[C] I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
[C] 'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night
[C] I should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh
[C] My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh
[V] There was a litany of reasons why
[V] We could've playеd for keeps this time
[V] I know I'm just repeating mysеlf
[V] Put me back on my shelf
[V] But first, pull the string
[V] And I'll tell you that he runs
[V] Because he loves me (He loves me)
[C] 'Cause you should've seen him when he first saw me
[C] My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
[C] I'm queen (I'm queen), of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
[C] 'Cause I knew too much, there was danger in the heat of my touch
[C] He saw forever, so he smashed it up, oh, oh
[C] My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh
[B] Once I fix me
[B] He's gonna miss me
[B] Once I fix me
[B] He's gonna miss me
[I] Just say when, I'd play again
[I] He was my best friend down at the sandlot
[I] I felt more when we played pretend
[I] Than with all the Kens
[I] 'Cause he took me out of my box
[I] Stole my tortured heart
[I] Left all these broken parts
[I] Told me I'm better off
[I] But I'm not
[I] I'm not, I'm not

[V] Did you really beam me up
[V] In a cloud of sparkling dust
[V] Just to do experiments on?
[V] Tell me I was the chosen one
[V] Showed me that this world is bigger than us
[V] Then sent me back where I came from
[C] For a moment, I knew cosmic love
[C] Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
[C] Everything comes out teenage petulance
[C] "Fuck it if I can't have him"
[C] "I might just die, it would make no difference"
[C] Down bad, wakin' up in blood
[C] Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
[C] Fuck it if I can't have us
[C] I might just not get up, I might stay
[C] Down bad
[C] Fuck it if I can't have him
[C] Down bad
[C] Fuck it if I can't have him
[V] Did you take all my old clothes
[V] Just to leave me here, naked and alone
[V] In a field in my same old town
[V] That somehow seems so hollow now?
[V] They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
[V] The existence of you
[C] For a moment, I was heavenstruck
[C] Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
[C] Everything comes out teenage petulance
[C] "Fuck it if I can't have him" (Fuck it if I can't have him)

[C] Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
[C] Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
[C] Fuck it if I can't have him
[B] I loved your hostile takeovers
[B] Encounters closer and closer
[B] All your indecent exposures
[B] How dare you say that it's—
[B] I'll build you a fort on some planet
[B] Where they can all understand it
[B] How dare you think it's romantic
[B] Leaving me safe and stranded
[B] 'Cause fuck it, I was in love
[B] So fuck you if I can't have us
[B] 'Cause fuck it, I was in love
[C] Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)

[I] So (So) long (Long), London (London)
[V] I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist
[V] I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift
[V] Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
[V] My spine split from carrying us up the hill
[V] Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill
[V] I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe
[C] Thinkin', "How much sad did you think I had
[C] Did you think I had in me?"
[C] Oh, the tragedy
[C] So long, London
[C] You'll find someone
[V] I didn't opt in to be your odd man out
[V] I founded the club she's heard great things about
[V] I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath
[V] I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
[V] The spirit was gonе, we would never come to
[V] And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free
[C] For so long, London
[C] Stitches undone
[C] Two graves, one gun
[C] I'll find someone
[B] And you say I abandoned the ship
[B] But I was going down with it
[B] My white-knuckle dying grip
[B] Holding tight to your quiet resentment
[B] And my friends said it isn't right to be scared
[B] Every day of a love affair
[B] Every breath feels like rarest air
[B] When you're not sure if he wants to be there
[C] So how much sad did you think I had
[C] Did you think I had in me?
[C] How much tragedy?
[C] Just how low did you
[C] Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?
[C] 'Fore I'd have to go be free?
[V] You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?
[V] I died on the altar waitin' for the proof
[V] You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days
[V] And I'm just getting color back into my face

[V] I forget how the West was won
[V] I forget if this was ever fun
[V] I just learned these people only raise you
[V] To cage you
[V] Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
[V] Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, "What a mess"
[V] I just learned these people try and save you
[V] 'Cause they hate you
[C] Too high a horse for a simple girl
[C] To rise above it
[C] They slammed the door on my whole world
[C] The one thing I wanted
[C] Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
[C] Scrеamin', "But, Daddy, I love him
[C] I'm havin' his baby"
[C] No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
[C] I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
[C] No, I'm not coming to my senses
[C] I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want
[V] Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
[V] Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
[V] Growin' up precocious sometimes means
[V] Not growin' up at all
[V] He was chaos, he was revelry
[V] Bedroom eyes like a remedy
[V] Soon enough, the elders had convened
[V] Down at the city hall
[C] "Stay away from her"
[C] The saboteurs protested too much
[C] Lord knows the words we never heard
[C] Just screeching tires and true love
[C] And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
[C] Screamin', "But, Daddy, I love him
[C] I'm havin' his baby"
[C] No, I'm not, but you should see your faces

[C] No, I'm not coming to my senses
[C] I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want
[C] I'll tell you something right now
[C] I'd rather burn my whole life down
[C] Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
[C] I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
[C] It's mine alone to disgrace
[C] I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing
[B] god save the most judgmental creeps
[B] Who say they want what's best for me
[B] Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
[B] Thinkin' it can change the beat
[B] Of my heart when he touches me
[B] And counteract the chemistry
[B] And undo the destiny
[B] You ain't gotta pray for me
[B] Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
[B] If all you want is gray for me
[B] Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice
[V] There's a lot of people in town that I
[V] Bestow upon my fakest smiles
[V] Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
[V] We came back when the heat died down
[V] Went to my parents and they came around
[V] All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over
[C] Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
[C] Even my daddy just loves him
[C] I'm his lady
[C] And, oh, my god, you should see your faces
[C] Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
[C] And, no, you can't come to the wedding
[C] I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want
[C] I'll tell you something right now
[C] You ain't gotta pray for me
[C] Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
[C] (He was chaos, he was revelry)
[C] If all you want is gray for me
[C] Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice
[I] Screamin', "But, Daddy, I love him
[I] I'm having his baby"
[I] No, I'm not
[I] But you should see your faces
[I] But, oh, my god, you should see your faces
[I] (He was chaos, he was revelry)
[I] (He was chaos, he was revelry)

[I] Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
[I] Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
[I] (Fresh out the slammer, oh)
[V] Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder
[V] He don't understand me
[V] Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
[V] He was with her in dreams
[C] Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
[C] Handcuffed to the spell I was under
[C] For just one hour of sunshine
[C] Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
[C] In the shade of how he was feeling
[C] But it's gonna be alright, I did my time
[C] Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
[C] Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
[C] (Frеsh out the slammer, oh)
[V] Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
[V] Toss the ashes off the ledge
[V] As I said in my letters, now that I know better
[V] I will never lose my baby again
[C] My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it
[C] Watch me daily disappearing
[C] For just one glimpse of his smile
[C] All those nights, he kept me goin'
[C] Swirled you into all of my poems
[C] Now we're at the starting line, I did my time
[C] Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'
[B] To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)
[B] To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
[B] And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
[B] Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
[B] At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
[B] Wearing imaginary rings
[I] But it's gonna be alright, I did my time

[V] You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too
[V] They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true
[V] And my friends all smell like weed or little babies
[V] And this city reeks of driving myself crazy
[C] Little did you know your home's really only
[C] A town you're just a guest in
[C] So you work your life away just to pay
[C] For a time-share down in Destin
[C] Florida
[C] Is one hell of a drug
[C] Florida
[C] Can I use you up?
[V] The hurricane with my name when it came
[V] I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away
[V] Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine
[V] Well, me and my ghosts, wе had a hell of a time
[V] Yes, I'm hauntеd, but I'm feeling just fine
[V] All my girls got their lace and their crimes
[V] And your cheating husband disappeared, well
[V] No one asks any questions here
[V] So I did my best to lay to rest
[V] All of the bodies that have ever been on my body
[V] And in my mind, they sink into the swamp
[V] Is that a bad thing to say in a song?
[C] Little did you know your home's really only
[C] The town you'll get arrested
[C] So you pack your life away just to wait out
[C] The shitstorm back in Texas
[C] Florida
[C] Is one hell of a drug
[C] Florida
[C] Can I use you up?
[B] I need to forget, so take me to Florida
[B] I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
[B] Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
[B] At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida
[B] I need to forget, so take me to Florida
[B] I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
[B] Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
[B] What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida
[B] It's one hell of a drug
[B] It's one hell of a drug
[B] Love left me like this and I don't want to exist
[B] So take me to Florida
[C] Little did you know your home's really only
[C] A town you're just a guest in (Florida)
[C] So you work your life away just to pay

[C] Little did you know your home's really only
[C] The town you'll get arrested (Florida)
[C] So you pack your life away just to wait out

[C] Florida
[C] Is one hell of a drug
[C] Florida
[C] Go on, fuck me up

[V] Drownin' in the Blue-Nile
[V] He sent me "Downtown-Lights"
[V] I hadn't heard it in a while
[V] My boredom's bone-deep
[V] This cage was once just fine
[V] Am I allowed to cry?
[V] I dream of crackin' locks
[V] Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
[V] Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
[V] I'm seeing visions
[V] Am I bad or mad or wise?
[C] What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
[C] One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
[C] Oh, what a way to die
[C] I keep recalling things we never did
[C] Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
[C] Without ever touchin' his skin
[C] How can I be guilty as sin?
[V] I keep these longings lockеd
[V] In lowercase, inside a vault
[V] Somеone told me, "There's no such thing as bad thoughts
[V] Only your actions talk"
[V] These fatal fantasies
[V] Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
[V] We've already done it in my head
[V] If it's make-believe
[V] Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?
[C] What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
[C] One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
[C] Oh, what a way to die
[C] My bed sheets are ablaze
[C] I've screamed his name
[C] Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave
[C] Without ever touchin' his skin
[C] How can I be guilty as sin?
[B] What if I roll the stone away?
[B] They're gonna crucify me anyway
[B] What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
[B] If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
[B] They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
[B] I choose you and me religiously
[C] What if he's written "mine" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
[C] One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
[C] Oh, what a way to die
[C] I keep recalling things we never did
[C] Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
[C] Without ever touchin' his skin
[C] How can I be guilty as sin?
[I] He sent me "Downtown-Lights"
[I] I hadn't heard it in a while
[I] Am I allowed to cry?

[V] The who's who of "Who's that?" is poised for the attack
[V] But my bare hands paved their paths
[V] You don't get to tell me about "sad"
[C] If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
[C] Nothing makes me feel more alive
[C] So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
[C] Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
[C] "Who's afraid of little old me?"
[C] You should be
[V] The scandal was contained
[V] The bullet had just grazed
[V] At all costs, keep your good name
[V] You don't get to tell me you feel bad
[C] Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one morе joke
[C] Then we could all just laugh until I cry
[C] So I lеap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
[C] Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
[C] "Who's afraid of little old me?"
[C] I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
[C] "Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth"
[C] Who's afraid of little old me?
[C] Well, you should be
[C] (You should be) You should be
[C] (You should be) You should be
[C] You should be (You should be)
[C] You should be (You should be)
[C] You should be
[B] So tell me everything is not about me
[B] But what if it is?
[B] Then say they didn't do it to hurt me
[B] But what if they did?
[B] I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
[B] You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
[B] So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
[B] I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?
[B] That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
[B] That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong
[B] Put narcotics into all of my songs
[B] And that's why you're still singin' along
[C] So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
[C] Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
[C] "Who's afraid of little old me?"
[C] I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
[C] "Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth"
[C] Who's afraid of little old me?
[C] Well, you should be
[C] (You should be) You should be
[C] (You should be) You should be
[C] 'Cause you lured me (You should be)
[C] And you hurt me (You should be)
[C] And you taught me
[I] You caged me and then you called me crazy
[I] I am what I am 'cause you trained me
[I] So who's afraid of me?
[I] Who's afraid of little old me?
[I] Who's afraid of little old me?

[V] The smoke cloud billows out his mouth
[V] Like a freight train through a small town
[V] The jokes that he told across the bar
[V] Were revolting and far too loud
[C] They shake their heads sayin', "god, help her"
[C] When I tell 'em he's my man
[C] But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
[C] I can fix him, no, really, I can
[C] And only I can
[V] The dopamine races through his brain
[V] On a six-lane Texas highway
[V] His hand so calloused from his pistol
[V] Softly traces hearts on my face
[V] And I could see it from a mile away
[V] A perfect case for my certain skill set
[V] He had a halo of the highest gradе
[V] He just hadn't met me yеt
[C] They shake their heads sayin', "god, help her"
[C] When I tell 'em he's my man
[C] But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger
[C] I can fix him, no, really, I can
[C] And only I can
[B] Good boy, that's right, come close
[B] I'll show you Heaven if you'll be an angel, all night
[B] Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man
[B] No, really, I can
[C] They shook their heads sayin', "god, help her"
[C] When I told 'em he's my man (I told 'em he's my man)
[C] But your good Lord didn't need to lift a finger
[C] I can fix him, no, really, I can (No, really, I can)
[C] Woah, maybe I can't

[V] Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
[V] If we know the steps anyway?
[V] We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
[V] Stitching, "We were just kids, babe"
[V] I said, "I don't mind, it takes time"
[V] I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
[V] I felt aglow like this
[V] Never before and never since
[C] If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
[C] You and I go from one kiss to getting married
[C] Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
[C] Never quite buried
[C] In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
[C] You low-down boy, you stand-up guy
[C] You Holy-Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
[C] You said I'm the love of your life
[C] About a million times
[V] Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
[V] And told me I reformed you?
[V] When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
[V] Well, you took me to hell too
[V] And all at once, the ink bleeds
[V] A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
[V] But I've felt a hole like this
[V] Never before and ever since
[C] If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
[C] What we thought was for all time was momentary
[C] Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
[C] Never quite buried
[C] You cinephile in black and white
[C] All those plot twists and dynamite
[C] Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
[C] You said I'm the love of your life
[B] You shit-talked me under the table
[B] Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
[B] I wish I could un-recall
[B] How we almost had it all
[B] Dancing phantoms on the terrace
[B] Are they second-hand embarrassed
[B] That I can't get out of bed
[B] 'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
[B] It was legendary
[B] It was momentary
[B] It was unnecessary
[B] Should've let it stay buried
[C] Oh, what a valiant roar
[C] What a bland goodbye
[C] The coward claimed he was a lion
[C] I'm combing through the braids of lies
[C] "I'll never leave," "Never mind"
[C] Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
[C] Your arson's match, your somber eyes
[C] And I'll still see it until I die
[C] You're the loss of my life

[V] I can read your mind
[V] "She's having the time of her life"
[V] There in her glittering prime
[V] The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
[V] I can show you lies
[V] (One, two, three, four)
[C] 'Cause I'm a real tough kid
[C] I can handle my shit
[C] They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it" and I did
[C] Lights, camera, bitch, smile
[C] Even when you wanna die
[C] He said he'd love me all his life
[C] But that life was too short
[C] Breaking down, I hit the floor
[C] All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting, "More"
[C] I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
[C] I was hittin' my marks
[C] 'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
[C] (One, two, three, four)
[C] I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
[C] I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
[C] I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
[C] You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
[V] I can hold my breath
[V] I've been doin' it since he left
[V] I keep finding his things in drawers
[V] Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
[V] I'm sure I can pass this test
[V] (One, two, three, four)
[C] 'Cause I'm a real tough kid
[C] I can handle my shit
[C] They said, "Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it" and I did
[C] Lights, camera, bitch, smile
[C] In stilettos for miles
[C] He said he'd love me for all time
[C] But that time was quite short
[C] Breaking down, I hit the floor
[C] All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, "More"
[C] I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
[C] I was hittin' my marks
[C] 'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
[C] (One, two, three, four)
[C] I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
[C] I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me (He avoids me), like the plague
[C] I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
[C] You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
[I] You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
[I] You know you're good
[I] And I'm good
[I] 'Cause I'm miserable (ha ha)
[I] And nobody even knows
[I] Ah, try and come for my job

[V] Was any of it true?
[V] Gazing at me starry-eyed
[V] In your Jehovah's-Witness suit
[V] Who the fuck was that guy?
[V] You tried to buy some pills
[V] From a friend of friends of mine
[V] They just ghosted you
[V] Now you know what it feels like
[C] And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
[C] If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
[C] And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
[C] A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
[V] You hung me on your wall
[V] Stabbed me with your push pins
[V] In public, showed me off
[V] Then sank in stoned oblivion
[V] 'Cause once your queen had come
[V] You'd treat her likе an also-ran
[V] You didn't measure up
[V] In any measurе of a man
[C] And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
[C] If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
[C] And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
[C] A message to the smallest man who ever lived?
[B] Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
[B] Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
[B] Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?
[B] In fifty years, will all this be declassified?
[B] And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, "Good riddance"
[B] 'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
[B] I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
[B] And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
[B] You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
[B] You crashed my party and your rental car
[B] You said normal girls were boring
[B] But you were gone by the morning
[B] You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing
[I] And in plain sight you hid
[I] But you are what you did
[I] And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
[I] The smallest man who ever lived

[V] This happens once every few lifetimes
[V] These chemicals hit me like white wine
[V] What if I told you I'm back?
[V] The hospital was a drag
[V] Worst sleep that I ever had
[V] I circled you on a map
[V] I haven't come around in so long
[V] But I'm coming back so strong
[C] So when I touch down
[C] Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
[C] Ditch the clowns, get the crown
[C] Baby, I'm the one to beat
[C] 'Cause the sign on your heart
[C] Said it's still reserved for me
[C] Honestly, who are we to fight thе alchemy?
[V] Hey, you, what if I told you we'rе cool?
[V] That child's play back in school
[V] Is forgiven under my rule
[V] I haven't come around in so long
[V] But I'm making a comeback to where I belong
[C] So when I touch down
[C] Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
[C] Ditch the clowns, get the crown
[C] Baby, I'm the one to beat
[C] 'Cause the sign on your heart
[C] Said it's still reserved for me
[C] Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
[C] These blokes warm the benches
[C] We've been on a winning streak
[C] He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an "E"
[C] 'Cause the sign on your heart
[C] Said it's still reserved for me
[C] Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
[B] Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads
[B] Beer stickin' to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said
[B] "There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league"
[B] Where's the trophy? He just comes runnin' over to me
[C] Touchdown
[C] Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
[C] Ditch the clowns, get the crown
[C] Baby, I'm the one to beat
[C] 'Cause the sign on your heart

[V] "You look like Clara-Bow
[V] In this light, remarkable
[V] All your life, did you know
[V] You'd be picked like a rose?"
[C] "I'm not trying to exaggerate
[C] But I think I might die if it happened
[C] Die if it happened to me
[C] No one in my small town
[C] Thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan"
[C] "This town is fake, but you're the real thing
[C] Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
[C] Take the glory, give everything
[C] Promise to be dazzling"
[V] "You look like Stevie-Nicks
[V] In '75, the hair and lips
[V] Crowd goes wild at her fingertips
[V] Half moonshine, a full еclipse"
[C] "I'm not trying to exaggeratе
[C] But I think I might die if I made it, die if I made it
[C] No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in L.A.
[C] They all wanna say..."
[C] "This town is fake, but you're the real thing
[C] Breath of fresh air through smoke rings
[C] Take the glory, give everything
[C] Promise to be dazzling
[C] The crown is stained, but you're the real queen
[C] Flesh and blood amongst war machines
[C] You're the new god we're worshipping
[C] Promise to be dazzling"
[B] Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours
[B] Demanding more
[B] Only when your girlish glow flickers just so
[B] Do they let you know
[B] It's hell on earth to be heavenly
[B] Them's the breaks, they don't come gently
[I] "You look like Taylor-Swift
[I] In this light, we're lovin' it
[I] You've got edge, she never did
[I] The future's bright, dazzling"

[V] I am someone who until recent events
[V] You shared your secrets with
[V] And your location, you forgot to turn it off
[V] And so I watch as you walk
[V] Into some bar called The-Black-Dog
[V] And pierce new holes in my heart
[V] You forgot to turn it off
[V] And it hits me
[C] I just don't understand
[C] How you don't miss me in The-Black-Dog
[C] When someone plays "The-Starting-Line"
[C] And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
[C] That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming
[C] Old habits die screaming
[V] I move through the world with the heartbroken
[V] My longings stay unspoken
[V] And I may never open up thе way I did for you
[V] And all of those best laid plans
[V] You said I needed a bravе man
[V] Then proceeded to play him
[V] Until I believed it too
[V] And it kills me
[C] I just don't understand
[C] How you don't miss me in the shower
[C] And remember how my rain-soaked body
[C] Was shakin', do you hate me?
[C] Was it hazing? For a cruel fraternity
[C] I pledged and I still mean it
[C] Old habits die screaming
[B] Six weeks of breathin' clean air
[B] I still miss the smoke
[B] Were you makin' fun of me
[B] With some esoteric joke?
[B] Now I wanna sell my house
[B] And set fire to all my clothes
[B] And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons
[B] Even if I die screaming
[B] And I hope you hear it
[C] And I hope it's shitty in The-Black-Dog
[C] When someone plays "The-Starting-Line"
[C] And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
[C] That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming
[C] 'Cause tail between your legs, you're leavin'
[I] I still can't believe it
[I] 'Cause old habits die screaming

[I] Yeah
[V] Lilac short skirt, the one that fits me like skin
[V] Did your research, you knew the price goin' in
[V] And I'll tell you one thing, honey
[V] I can tell when somebody still wants me, come clean
[V] Standin' at the bar like something's funny, bubbly
[V] Once you fix your face, I'm goin' in (Yeah)
[C] Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
[C] Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
[C] But I'm gonna get you back
[C] Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
[C] Take you back to my house, I haven't decidеd yet
[C] But I'm gonna get you back
[C] I, I hear thе whispers in your eyes
[C] I'll make you wanna think twice
[C] You'll find that you were never not mine
[C] (You're mine)
[V] Small talk, big love, act like I don't care what you did
[V] I'm an Aston-Martin that you steered straight into the ditch
[V] Then ran and hid
[V] And I'll tell you one thing, honey
[V] I can take the upper hand and touch your body
[V] Flip the script and leave you like a dumb house party
[V] Or I might just love you 'til the end
[C] Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
[C] Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
[C] But I'm gonna get you back
[C] Whether I'm gonna flip you off or
[C] Pull you into the closet, I haven't decided yet
[C] But I'm gonna get you back
[C] I, I hear the whispers in your eyes
[C] I'll make you wanna think twice
[C] You'll find that you were never not mine
[C] (You're mine)
[B] I can feel it coming, humming in the way you move
[B] Push the reset button, we're becomin' something new
[B] Say you got somebody, I'll say I got someone too
[B] Even if it's handcuffed, I'm leavin' here with you
[B] Bygones will be bygone, eras fadin' into gray (Fading into gray)
[B] We broke all the pieces, but still wanna play the game (Oh)
[B] Told my friends I hate you, but I love you just the same
[B] Pick your poison, babe, I'm poison either way
[C] Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
[C] Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet
[C] But I'm gonna get you back
[C] Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
[C] Take you back to my house, I haven't decided yet
[C] But I'm gonna get you back
[C] I, I hear the whispers in your eyes
[C] I'll make you wanna think twice
[C] You'll find that you were never not mine
[I] I'm gonna get you back

[V] Wise men once said
[V] "Wild winds are death to the candle"
[V] A rose by any other name is a scandal
[V] Cautions issued, he stood
[V] Shooting the messengers
[V] They tried to warn him about her
[C] Cross your thoughtless heart
[C] Only liquor anoints you
[C] She's the albatross
[C] She is here to destroy you
[V] Wise men once said
[V] "One bad seed kills the garden"
[V] "One less temptress, one less dagger to sharpen"
[V] Locked me up in towers
[V] But I'd visit in your dreams
[V] And they tried to warn you about me
[C] Cross your thoughtless heart
[C] Only liquor anoints you
[C] She's the albatross
[C] She is here to destroy you
[C] Devils that you know
[C] Raise worse hell than a stranger
[C] She's the death you chose
[C] You're in terrible danger
[B] And when that sky rains fire on you
[B] And you're persona-non-grata
[B] I'll tell you how I've been there too
[B] And that none of it matters
[V] Wise men once read fake news
[V] And they believed it
[V] Jackals raised their hackles
[V] You couldn't conceive it
[V] You were sleeping soundly
[V] When they dragged you from your bed
[V] And I tried to warn you about them
[C] So I crossed my thoughtless heart
[C] Spread my wings like a parachute
[C] I'm the albatross
[C] I swept in at the rescue
[C] The devil that you know
[C] Looks now more like an angel
[C] I'm the life you chose
[C] And all this terrible danger
[C] (This terrible danger)
[I] So cross your thoughtless heart
[I] She's the albatross
[I] She is here to destroy you

[V] Your hologram stumbled into my apartment
[V] Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness
[V] Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus
[V] And I just watched it happen
[V] As the decade would play us for fools
[V] And you saw my bones out with somebody new
[V] Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school
[V] And you just watched it happen
[C] If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
[C] Just say, "I loved you the way that you were"
[C] If you wanna tear my world apart
[C] Just say you've always wondered
[V] You said some things that I can't unabsorb
[V] You turned me into an idea of sorts
[V] You needed me, but you needed drugs more
[V] And I couldn't watch it happen
[V] I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools
[V] Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules
[V] All to outrun my desertion of you
[V] And you just watched it
[C] If you wanna break my cold, cold heart
[C] Just say, "I loved you the way that you were"
[C] If you wanna tear my world apart
[C] Just say you've always wondered
[B] If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh
[B] Down that passage in time back to the moment
[B] I crashed into you, like so many wrecks do
[B] Too impaired by my youth to know what to do
[V] So if I sell my apartment
[V] And you have some kids with an internet starlet
[V] Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon?
[V] Like it never happened
[V] Could it be enough to just float in your orbit?
[V] Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?
[V] Cooler in theory, but not if you force it to be
[V] It just didn't happen
[C] So if you wanna break my cold, cold heart
[C] Say you loved me
[C] And if you wanna tear my world apart
[C] Say you'll always wonder
[I] 'Cause I wonder
[I] Will I always
[I] Will I always wonder?

[I] (Uh-oh, uh-oh)
[V] We hereby conduct this post-mortem
[V] He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsman
[V] Our maladies were such we could not cure them
[V] And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign
[C] Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
[C] The empathetic hunger descends
[C] We'll tell no one except all of our friends
[C] We must know
[C] How did it end?
[C] (Uh-oh, uh-oh)
[V] We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
[V] We learned thе right steps to different dancеs
[V] And fell victim to interlopers' glances
[V] Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?
[V] Soon, they'll go home to their husbands
[V] Smug 'cause they know they can trust him
[V] Then feverishly calling their cousins
[C] "Guess who we ran into at the shops?
[C] Walking in circles like she was lost
[C] Didn't you hear? They called it all off"
[C] One gasp and then
[C] "How did it end?"
[B] Say it once again with feeling
[B] How the death rattle breathing
[B] Silenced as the soul was leaving
[B] The deflation of our dreaming
[B] Leaving me bereft and reeling
[B] My beloved ghost and me
[B] Sitting in a tree
[B] D-Y-I-N-G
[C] It's happenin' again
[C] How did it end?
[C] I can't pretend like I understand
[C] How did it end?
[C] Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
[C] The empathetic hunger descends
[C] We'll tell no one except all of our friends
[C] But I still don't know
[C] How did it end

[I] I feel so high school every time I look at you
[I] I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you
[C] And in a blink of a crinklin' eye
[C] I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
[C] Cheeks pink in the twinkling lights
[C] Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
[C] I'll drink what you think, and I'm high
[C] From smokin' your jokes all damn night
[C] The brink of a wrinkle in time
[C] Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
[C] I'm watchin' American-Pie with you on a Saturday night
[C] Your friends are around, so be quiet
[C] I'm trying to stifle my sighs
[C] 'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you
[C] But look at you
[C] Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
[V] Are you gonna marry, kiss or kill me? (Kill me)
[V] It's just a game, but really (Really)
[V] I'm bettin' on all three for us two (All three)
[V] Get my car door, isn't that sweet? (That sweet)
[V] Then pull me to thе backseat (The backseat)
[V] No onе's ever had me (Had me), not like you
[B] Truth, dare, spin bottles
[B] You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
[B] Brand-new, full throttle
[B] Touch me while your bros play Grand-Theft-Auto
[B] It's true, swear, scouts honor
[B] You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
[B] Brand-new, full throttle
[B] You already know, babe
[V] I feel like laughin' in the middle of practice
[V] Do that impression you did of your dad again
[V] I'm hearing voices like a madman
[C] And in a blink of a crinklin' eye
[C] I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
[C] Cheeks pink in the twinkling lights
[C] Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
[C] I'll drink what you think, and I'm high
[C] From smokin' your jokes all damn night
[C] The brink of a wrinkle in time
[C] Bittersweet sixteen suddenly
[C] I'm watchin' American-Pie with you on a Saturday night
[C] Your friends are around, so be quiet
[C] I'm trying to stifle my sighs
[C] 'Cause I feel so high school (Feel so high school) every time I look at you
[C] But look at you
[I] Truth, dare, spin bottles
[I] You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
[I] Brand-new, full throttle
[I] Touch me while your bros play Grand-Theft-Auto
[I] It's true, swear, scouts honor
[I] You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
[I] Brand-new, full throttle
[I] You already know, babe
[I] You already know, babe

[V] Quick, quick, tell me something awful
[V] Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy
[V] Tell me all your secrets, all you'll ever be is
[V] My eternal consolation prize
[V] You see, I was a debutante in another life, but
[V] Now I seem to be scared to go outside
[V] If comfort is a construct, I don't believe in good luck
[V] Now that I know what's what
[C] I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind
[C] People need a key to get to, the only one is mine
[C] I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
[C] No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
[C] I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
[C] I hate it here
[V] My friends used to play a game where
[V] We would pick a decade
[V] We wished we could live in instead of this
[V] I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists
[V] And getting married off for the highest bid
[V] Everyone would look down 'cause it wasn't fun now
[V] Seems like it was never even fun back then
[V] Nostalgia is a mind's trick
[V] If I'd been there, I'd hate it
[V] It was freezing in the palace
[C] I hate it here so I will go to lunar valleys in my mind
[C] When they found a better planet, only the gentle survived
[C] I dreamed about it in the dark, the night I felt like I might die
[C] No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
[C] I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
[C] I hate it here
[B] I'm lonely, but I'm good
[B] I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine
[B] I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose
[B] This place made me feel worthless
[B] Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me
[B] And in my fantasies, I rise above it
[B] And way up there, I actually love it
[C] I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind
[C] People need a key to get to, the only one is mine
[C] I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
[C] No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
[C] I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
[C] I hate it here
[I] Quick, quick, tell me something awful
[I] Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy

[V] When I picture my hometown
[V] There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
[V] And a plaque underneath it
[V] That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school
[C] And it was always the same searing pain
[C] But I dreamed that one day I could say
[C] All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
[C] And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
[C] Screamed, "Fuck you, Aimee" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
[C] But I can't forget the way you made me heal
[V] And it wasn't a fair fight
[V] Or a clean kill each time that Aimee stompеd across my grave
[V] And then she wrotе headlines
[V] In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take
[C] And it was always the same searing pain
[C] But I prayed that one day I could say
[C] All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
[C] And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
[C] Screamed, "Fuck you, Aimee" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
[C] But I can't forget the way you made me heal
[C] Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
[C] But she used to say she wished that you were dead
[C] I pushed each boulder up the hill
[C] Your words are still just ringing in my head, ringing in my head
[B] I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
[B] I built a legacy that you can't undo
[B] But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
[B] That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you
[V] And maybe you've reframed it
[V] And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue
[V] I don't think you've changed much
[V] And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
[V] And one day, your kid comes home singin'
[V] A song that only us two is gonna know is about you, 'cause
[C] All that time you were throwin' punches, it was all for nothin'
[C] And our town, it looks so small from way up here
[C] Screamed, "Thank you, Aimee" to the night sky and the stars are stunnin'
[C] 'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
[C] Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
[C] But she used to say she wished that you were dead
[C] So I pushed each boulder up that hill
[C] Your words were still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head
[I] Thank you, Aimee
[I] Thank you, Aimee

[V] I had died the tiniest death
[V] I spied the catch in your breath
[V] Out, out, out, out, out, out
[V] Northbound I got carried away
[V] As you boarded your train
[V] South, south, south, south, south, south
[C] A feather taken by the wind blowing
[C] I'm afflicted by the not knowing so
[C] I look in people's windows
[C] Transfixed by rose golden glows
[C] They have their friends over to drink nice wine
[C] I look in people's windows
[C] In case you're at their table
[C] What if your eyes looked up and met mine
[C] One more time
[V] You had stopped and tiltеd your head
[V] I still ponder what it meant
[V] Now, now, now, now, now, now
[V] I triеd searching faces on streets
[V] What are the chances you'd be
[V] Downtown, downtown, downtown
[C] Does it feel alright to not know me?
[C] I'm addicted to the "if only"
[C] So I look in people's windows
[C] Like I'm some deranged weirdo
[C] I attend Christmas parties from outside
[C] I look in people's windows
[C] In case you're at their table
[C] What if your eyes looked up and met mine
[C] One more time

[V] Hand on the throttle
[V] Thought I caught lightning in a bottle
[V] Oh, but it's gone again
[V] And it was written
[V] I got cursed like Eve got bitten
[V] Oh, was it punishment?
[V] Pad around when I get home
[V] I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
[V] A greater woman wouldn't beg
[V] But I looked to the sky and said
[C] Please
[C] I've been on my knees
[C] Change the prophecy
[C] Don't want money
[C] Just someone who wants my company
[C] Let it once be me
[C] Who do I have to speak to
[C] About if they can redo the prophecy?
[V] Cards on thе table
[V] Mine play out like fools in a fablе
[V] Oh, it was sinking in (Sinking in, oh)
[V] Slow is the quicksand
[V] Poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand
[V] Oh, still I dream of him
[C] Please
[C] I've been on my knees
[C] Change the prophecy
[C] Don't want money
[C] Just someone who wants my company
[C] Let it once be me
[C] Who do I have to speak to
[C] About if they can redo the prophecy?
[B] And I sound like an infant
[B] Feeling like the very last drops of an ink pen
[B] A greater woman stays cool
[B] But I howl like a wolf at the moon
[B] And I look unstable
[B] Gathered with a coven 'round a sorceress' table
[B] A greater woman has faith
[B] But even statues crumble if they're made to wait
[B] I'm so afraid I sealed my fate
[B] No sign of soulmates
[B] I'm just a paperweight in shades of greige
[B] Spending my last coin so someone will tell me it'll be okay
[B] Ooh
[B] Ooh
[B] Ooh
[B] Ooh
[C] Please
[C] I've been on my knees
[C] Change the prophecy
[C] Don't want money
[C] Just someone who wants my company
[C] Let it once be me
[C] Who do I have to speak to
[C] About if they can redo the prophecy?
[C] Who do I have to speak to
[C] To change the prophecy?
[I] Hand on the throttle
[I] Thought I caught lightning in a bottle
[I] Oh, but it's gone again
[I] Pad around when I get home
[I] I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
[I] A greater woman wouldn't beg
[I] But I looked to the sky and said (Please)

[V] I was in my new house placing daydreams
[V] Patching up the crack along the wall
[V] I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
[V] 'Cause that's where I was when I got the call
[C] When the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'
[C] In the streets, there's a raging riot
[C] When it's "Burn the bitch," they're shrieking
[C] When the truth comes out, it's quiet
[C] So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
[C] And tried to tell the town
[C] So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
[C] Do you believe me now?
[V] I was in my tower weaving nightmares
[V] Twisting all my smiles into snarls
[V] They say, "What doesn't kill you makes you aware"
[V] What happens if it becomes who you are?
[C] So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
[C] And tried to tell the town
[C] So they set my life in flames, I regret to say
[C] Do you believe me now?
[B] They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time
[B] That I was onto somethin'
[B] The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line
[B] They all said nothin'
[B] Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll
[B] Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
[B] You can mark my words that I said it first
[B] In a mourning warning, no one heard
[V] I patched up the crack along the wall
[V] I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
[V] 'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all
[C] So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
[C] And tried to tell the town
[C] So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
[C] Do you believe me now?
[B] Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah
[B] I was onto somethin'
[B] Ah-ah-ah, ah
[B] They all said nothin'
[B] Blood's thick but nothin' like a payroll
[B] Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
[B] You can mark my words that I said it first
[B] In a mourning warning, no one heard
[B] No one heard, not a single word was heard
[I] When the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'
[I] In the streets, there's a raging riot
[I] When it's "Burn the bitch," they're shrieking
[I] When the truth comes out, it's quiet
[I] It's so quiet

[V] Forgive me, Peter
[V] My lost fearless leader
[V] In closets like cedar
[V] Preserved from when we were just kids
[V] Is it somethin' I did?
[V] The goddess of timing
[V] Once found us beguiling
[V] She said she was trying
[V] Peter, was she lying?
[V] My ribs get the feeling she did
[C] And I didn't wanna come down
[C] I thought it was just goodbye for now
[C] You said you were gonna grow up
[C] Then you were gonna come find me
[C] Said you were gonna grow up
[C] Thеn you were gonna come find mе
[C] Said you were gonna grow up
[C] Then you were gonna come find me
[C] Words from the mouths of babes
[C] Promises oceans deep
[C] But never to keep
[C] Oh, never to keep
[V] Are you still a mind reader?
[V] A natural scene stealer?
[V] I've heard great things, Peter
[V] But life was always easier on you
[V] Than it was on me
[V] And sometimes it gets me
[V] When crossing your jet stream
[V] We both did the best we could do
[V] Underneath the same moon
[V] In different galaxies
[C] And I didn't wanna hang around
[C] We said it was just goodbye for now
[C] You said you were gonna grow up
[C] Then you were gonna come find me
[C] Said you were gonna grow up
[C] Then you were gonna come find me
[C] Said you were gonna grow up
[C] Then you were gonna come find me
[C] Words from the mouths of babes
[C] Promises oceans deep
[C] But never to keep
[C] Never to keep
[B] And I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn
[B] As the men masqueraded, I hoped you'd return
[B] With your feet on the ground, tell me all that you'd learned
[B] 'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned
[B] And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five
[B] And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired
[B] Lost to the "Lost-Boys" chapter of your life
[B] Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried
[B] To hold on (Hold on) to the days (To the days)
[B] When you were mine
[B] But the woman who sits by the window
[B] Has turned out the light
[C] You said you were gonna grow up
[C] Then you were gonna come find me
[C] Said you were gonna grow up
[C] You said you were gonna grow up
[C] Then you were gonna come find me
[C] Said you were gonna grow up
[C] You said you were gonna grow up
[C] Then you were gonna come find me
[C] Said you were gonna grow up
[C] Then you were gonna come find me
[C] Said you were gonna grow up
[C] Then you were gonna come find me
[C] Words from the mouths of babes
[C] Promises oceans deep
[C] But never to keep

[V] By all accounts, she almost drowned
[V] When she was six in frigid water
[V] And I can confirm she made
[V] A curious child, ever reviled
[V] By everyone except her own father
[V] With a quite bewitching face
[V] Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless
[V] Excellent fun 'til you get to know her
[V] Then she runs like it's a race
[V] Behind her back, her best mates laughed
[V] And they nicknamed her "The-Bolter"
[C] Started with a kiss
[C] "Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
[C] But it always ends up with a town car speeding
[C] Out the drive one evening
[C] Ended with the slam of a door
[C] Then he'll call her a whore
[C] Wish he wouldn't be sore
[C] But as she was leaving
[C] It felt like breathing
[C] All her fuckin' lives
[C] Flashed before her eyes
[C] It feels like the time
[C] She fell through the ice
[C] Then came out alive
[V] He was a cad, wanted her bad
[V] Just like any good trophy hunter
[V] And she liked the way it tastes
[V] Taming a bear, making him care
[V] Watching him jump then pulling him under
[V] And at first blush, this is fate
[V] When it's all roses, portrait poses
[V] Central-Park-Lake in tiny rowboats
[V] What a charming Saturday
[V] That's when she sees the littlest leaks
[V] Down in the floorboards
[V] And she just knows she must bolt
[C] Started with a kiss
[C] "Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
[C] But it always ends up with a town car speeding
[C] Out the drive one evening
[C] Ended with the slam of a door
[C] Then he'll call her a whore
[C] Wish he wouldn't be sore
[C] But as she was leaving
[C] It felt like breathing
[C] All her fuckin' lives
[C] Flashed before her eyes (Ah-ah-ah)
[C] It feels like the time
[C] She fell through the ice
[C] Then came out alive
[B] She's been many places with
[B] Men of many faces
[B] First, they're off to the races
[B] And she's laughing, drawin' aces
[B] But none of it is changin'
[B] That the chariot is waitin'
[B] Hearts are hers for the breakin'
[B] There's escape in escaping
[C] Started with a kiss
[C] "Oh, we must stop meeting like this"
[C] But it always ends up with a town car speeding
[C] Out the drive one evenin'
[C] Ended with the slam of a door
[C] But she's got the best stories
[C] You can be sure
[C] That as she was leaving
[C] It felt like freedom
[C] All her fuckin' lives
[C] Flashed before her eyes (And she realized)
[C] It feels like the time
[C] She fell through the ice
[C] Then came out alive

[V] Long may you reign
[V] You're an animal, you are bloodthirsty
[V] Out window panes talking utter nonsense
[V] You have no idea
[C] Strings tied to levers
[C] Slowed-down clocks tethered
[C] All this showmanship
[C] To keep it for you in sweetness
[C] Way to go, tiger
[C] Higher and higher
[C] Wilder and lighter
[C] For you
[V] Long may you roar
[V] At your dinosaurs
[V] You're a just ruler
[V] Covered in mud, you look ridiculous
[V] And you have no idea
[C] Buried down deep
[C] And out of your reach
[C] The secret we all vowed
[C] To keep it from you in sweetness
[C] Way to go, tiger
[C] Higher and higher
[C] Wilder and lighter
[C] For you
[B] You got the dragonflies above your bed
[B] You have a favorite spot on the swing set
[B] You have no room in your dreams for regrets
[B] (You have no idea)
[B] The time will arrive for the cruel and the mean
[B] You'll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline
[B] But now we'll curtail your curiosity
[B] In sweetness
[C] Way to go, tiger (Way to go, tiger)
[C] Higher and higher (Higher and higher)
[C] Wilder and lighter
[C] For you

[V] Now and then she rereads the manuscript
[V] Of the entire torrid affair
[V] They compared their licenses
[V] He said, "I'm not a donor but
[V] I'd give you my heart if you needed it"
[V] She rolled her eyes and said
[V] "You're a professional"
[V] He said, "No, just a good samaritan"
[V] He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was
[V] Soon they'd be pushin' strollers
[V] But soon it was over
[V] In the age of him, she wished she was thirty
[V] And made coffee every morning in a Frеnch-press
[V] Afterwards she only atе kids' cereal
[V] And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed
[V] Then she dated boys who were her own age
[V] With dart boards on the backs of their doors
[V] She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years
[V] Everything had been above board
[V] She wasn't sure
[B] And the years passed
[B] Like scenes of a show
[B] The professor said to write what you know
[B] Lookin' backwards
[B] Might be the only way to move forward
[B] Then the actors
[B] Were hitting their marks
[B] And the slow dance
[B] Was alight with the sparks
[B] And the tears fell
[B] In synchronicity with the score
[B] And at last
[B] She knew what the agony had been for
[V] The only thing that's left is the manuscript
[V] One last souvenir from my trip to your shores
[V] Now and then I reread the manuscript
[V] But the story isn't mine anymore

[V] He said the way my blue eyes shined
[V] Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
[V] I said, "That's a lie"
[V] Just a boy in a Chevy truck
[V] That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
[V] On backroads at night
[C] And I was right there beside him all summer long
[C] And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
[C] But when you think Tim-McGraw
[C] I hope you think my favorite song
[C] The one we danced to all night long
[C] The moon like a spotlight on the lake
[C] When you think happiness
[C] I hope you think that little black dress
[C] Think of my head on your chest
[C] And my old faded blue jeans
[C] When you think Tim-McGraw
[C] I hope you think of me
[V] September saw a month of tears
[V] And thankin' god that you weren't here
[V] To see me like that
[V] But in a box beneath my bed
[V] Is a letter that you never read
[V] From three summers back
[C] It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
[C] And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe
[C] When you think Tim-McGraw
[C] I hope you think my favorite song
[C] The one we danced to all night long
[C] The moon like a spotlight on the lake
[C] When you think happiness
[C] I hope you think that little black dress
[C] Think of my head on your chest
[C] And my old faded blue jeans
[C] When you think Tim-McGraw
[C] I hope you think of me
[B] And I'm back for the first time since then
[B] I'm standin' on your street
[B] And there's a letter left on your doorstep
[B] And the first thing that you'll read
[C] Is, "When you think Tim-McGraw
[C] I hope you think my favorite song
[C] Someday you'll turn your radio on
[C] I hope it takes you back to that place"
[C] When you think happiness
[C] I hope you think that little black dress
[C] Think of my head on your chest
[C] And my old faded blue jeans
[C] When you think Tim-McGraw
[C] I hope you think of me
[I] Oh, think of me, mmm
[I] He said the way my blue eyes shined
[I] Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
[I] I said, "That's a lie"

[V] State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
[V] I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
[V] So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
[V] That's fine, you won't mind if I say
[V] By the way
[C] I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
[C] You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
[C] So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
[C] As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
[V] There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
[V] There's nothing stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
[V] And if you come around sayin' sorry to me
[V] My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be
[C] 'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
[C] You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
[C] So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
[C] As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
[B] And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
[B] 'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health
[C] 'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
[C] You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
[C] So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
[C] In case you haven't heard
[C] I really, really hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
[C] You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
[C] So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
[C] As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn
[I] Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
[I] You're just another picture to burn
[I] Baby, burn

[V] Drew looks at me
[V] I fake a smile so he won't see
[V] That I want and I'm needing
[V] Everything that we should be
[C] I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
[C] And she's got everything that I have to live without
[V] Drew talks to me
[V] I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
[V] That I can't even see
[V] Anyone when he's with me
[C] He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
[C] I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
[C] He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
[C] The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
[C] He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
[V] Drew walks by me
[V] Can he tell that I can't breathe?
[V] And there he goes, so perfectly
[V] The kind of flawless I wish I could be
[C] She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
[C] Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
[C] He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
[C] The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
[C] He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
[C] So I'll drive home alone as I turn off the light
[C] I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
[C] 'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
[C] The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
[C] He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
[I] He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
[I] And he's all that I need to fall into
[I] Drew looks at me
[I] I fake a smile, so he won't see

[V] I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
[V] 'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
[V] Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
[V] Trying to see through the rain coming down
[V] Even though I'm not the only one
[V] Who feels the way I do
[C] I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
[C] I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
[C] Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
[V] Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
[V] And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
[V] Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
[V] Could you tell me what more do I need?
[V] And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah
[V] But that's okay
[C] I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
[C] I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
[C] Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
[B] Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
[B] But I'm ready to fly
[C] I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
[C] I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
[C] Oh, I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
[C] Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world
[I] Oh, I'm just a girl
[I] Oh, I'm just a girl, oh, oh
[I] Oh, I'm just a girl

[V] You have a way of coming easily to me
[V] And when you take, you take the very best of me
[V] So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
[V] And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted
[C] Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
[C] Given to a perfect day
[C] Just walk away, ain't no use defending
[C] Words that you will never say
[C] And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
[C] I've never been anywhere cold as you
[V] You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
[V] And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
[V] And you come away with a great little story
[V] Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you
[C] Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
[C] Given to a perfect day
[C] So just walk away, ain't no use defending
[C] Words that you will never say
[C] And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
[C] I've never been anywhere cold as you
[B] You never did give a damn thing, honey
[B] But I cried, cried for you
[B] And I know you wouldn't have told nobody
[B] If I died, died for you, died for you
[C] Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
[C] Given to a perfect day, oh
[C] Every smile you fake is so condescending
[C] Counting all the scars you made
[C] And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
[C] I've never been anywhere cold as you
[C] Ooh-oh

[V] I didn't know what I would find
[V] When I went looking for a reason, I know
[V] I didn't read between the lines
[V] And, baby, I've got nowhere to go
[C] I tried to take the road less traveled by
[C] But nothing seems to work the first few times
[C] Am I right?
[C] So how can I ever try to be better?
[C] Nobody ever lets me in
[C] I can still see you, this ain't the best view
[C] On the outside looking in
[C] I've been a lot of lonely places
[C] I've never been on the outside
[V] You saw me there, but never knew
[V] That I would give it all up to be
[V] A part of this, a part of you
[V] And now, it's all too late, so you see
[C] You could've helped if you had wanted to
[C] But no one notices until it's too late to do anything
[C] How can I ever try to be better?
[C] Nobody ever lets me in
[C] I can still see you, this ain't the best view
[C] On the outside looking in
[C] I've been a lot of lonely places
[C] I've never been on the outside
[C] Oh, yeah
[C] How can I ever try to be better?
[C] Nobody ever lets me in
[C] And I can still see you, this ain't the best view
[C] On the outside looking in
[C] I've been a lot of lonely places
[C] I've never been on the outside
[I] Oh-oh
[I] Oh, oh-oh
[I] Oh-oh
[I] Oh-oh

[V] Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
[V] Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
[V] You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
[V] But that's not true
[V] 'Cause I know you
[C] Hold on, baby, you're losing it
[C] The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
[C] And no one knows
[C] That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
[C] That you might not be the golden one
[C] And you're tied together with a smile
[C] But you're coming undone, oh
[V] I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
[V] 'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
[V] Hoping it will end up in his pocket (Pocket)
[V] But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
[V] Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
[V] It's not his price to pay
[C] Hold on, baby, you're losing it
[C] The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
[C] And no one knows
[C] That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
[C] That you might not be the golden one
[C] And you're tied together with a smile
[C] But you're coming undone, oh
[C] Oh, oh
[C] Hold on, baby, you're losing it
[C] The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go
[C] And no one knows
[C] That you cry but you don't tell anyone
[C] That you might not be the golden one
[C] And you're tied together with a smile
[C] But you're coming undone, oh
[I] You're tied together with a smile
[I] But you're coming undone, oh, oh-oh
[I] Goodbye, baby
[I] With a smile, baby, baby
[I] Oh

[V] Cory's eyes are like a jungle
[V] He smiles, it's like the radio
[V] He whispers songs into my window
[V] In words that nobody knows
[V] There's pretty girls on every corner
[V] They watch him as he's walking home
[V] Saying, "Does he know?"
[V] Will you ever know?
[C] You're beautiful, every little piece, love
[C] Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
[C] Ask anyone
[C] And when you find everything you looked for
[C] I hope your life leads you back to my door
[C] Oh, but if it don't
[C] Stay beautiful
[V] Cory finds another way to be
[V] The highlight of my day
[V] I'm taking pictures in my mind
[V] So I can save 'em for a rainy day
[V] It's hard to make a conversation
[V] When he's taking my breath away
[V] I should say, "Hey, by the way"
[C] You're beautiful, every little piece, love
[C] Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
[C] Ask anyone
[C] And when you find everything you looked for
[C] I hope your life leads you back to my door
[C] Oh, but if it don't
[C] Stay beautiful
[B] If you and I are a story
[B] That never gets told
[B] If what you are is a daydream
[B] I'll never get to hold, at least you'll know
[C] You're beautiful, every little piece, love
[C] Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?
[C] Ask anyone
[C] And when you find everything you looked for
[C] I hope your life leads you back to my front door
[C] Oh, but if it don't
[C] Will you stay beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
[C] Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
[I] La-la-la
[I] Oh-oh-oh
[I] Oh-oh-oh-oh
[I] Oh, but if it don't
[I] Stay beautiful, stay beautiful
[I] Na-na-na, na-na

[V] It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
[V] The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
[V] Yesterday, I found out about you
[V] Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong
[C] You say that you'd take it all back
[C] Given one chance
[C] It was a moment of weakness
[C] And you said yes
[C] You should've said no, you should've gone home
[C] You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
[C] You should've known that word
[C] 'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
[C] And I should've been there in the back of your mind
[C] I shouldn't be asking myself why
[C] You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
[C] You should've said no
[C] Baby, and you might still have me
[V] You can see that I've been cryin'
[V] And baby, you know all the right things to say
[V] But do you honestly expect me to believe
[V] We could ever be the same?
[C] You say that the past is the past
[C] You need one chance
[C] It was a moment of weakness
[C] And you said yes
[C] You should've said no, you should've gone home
[C] You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
[C] You should've known that word
[C] 'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
[C] And I should've been there in the back of your mind

[C] You should've said no
[C] Baby, and you might still have me
[C] Oh, oh
[B] I can't resist
[B] Before you go, tell me this
[B] Was it worth it?
[B] Was she worth this?
[B] No, no
[B] No, no, no, no
[C] You should've said no, you should've gone home
[C] You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
[C] You should've known that word

[V] She said I was seven and you were nine
[V] I looked at you like the stars that shined
[V] In the sky, the pretty lights
[V] And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
[V] Growing up and falling in love
[V] And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
[V] And said, "Oh, my, my, my"
[C] Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
[C] Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
[C] You never did, you never did
[C] Take me back when our world was one block wide
[C] I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
[C] Just two kids, you and I
[C] Oh, my, my, my, my
[V] Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
[V] I wasn't that little girl you used to see
[V] But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
[V] And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
[V] They never believed we'd really fall in love
[V] And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
[V] And said, "Oh, my, my, my"
[C] Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
[C] 2AM riding in your truck
[C] And all I need is you next to me
[C] Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
[C] The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight
[C] You stayed outside 'til the morning light
[C] Oh, my, my, my, my
[B] A few years had gone and come around
[B] We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
[B] And you looked at me, got down on one knee
[C] Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
[C] Our whole town came and our mamas cried
[C] You said, "I do," and I did, too
[C] Take me home where we met so many years before
[C] We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
[C] After all this time, you and I
[I] And I'll be eighty-seven, you'll be eighty-nine
[I] I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
[I] In the sky, oh, my, my, my

[V] I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
[V] In the front seat of his car
[V] He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
[V] The other on my heart
[V] I look around, turn the radio down
[V] He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
[V] I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin'
[V] How we don't have a song"
[V] And he says
[C] Our song is a slamming screen door
[C] Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
[C] When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
[C] 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
[C] Our song is the way you laugh
[C] The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have"
[C] And when I got home, 'fore I said, "Amen"
[C] Askin' god if he could play it again
[V] I was walking up the front porch steps
[V] After everything that day
[V] Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
[V] And lost and thrown away
[V] Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
[V] I almost didn't notice all the roses
[V] And the note that said
[C] Our song is a slamming screen door
[C] Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
[C] When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
[C] 'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
[C] Our song is the way you laugh
[C] The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have"
[C] And when I got home, 'fore I said, "Amen"
[C] Askin' god if he could play it again
[C] Da-da-da-da
[B] I've heard every album, listened to the radio
[B] Waited for somethin' to come along
[B] That was as good as our song
[C] 'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
[C] Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
[C] When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
[C] 'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
[C] Our song is the way he laughs
[C] The first date, "Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have"
[C] And when I got home, 'fore I said, "Amen"
[C] Askin' god if he could play it again
[C] Play it again, oh yeah
[C] Oh-oh, yeah
[I] I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
[I] In the front seat of his car
[I] I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
[I] And I wrote down our song

[V] Friday night beneath the stars
[V] In a field behind your yard
[V] You and I are painting pictures in the sky
[V] And sometimes, we don't say a thing
[V] Just listen to the crickets sing
[V] Everything I need is right here by my side
[C] And I know everything about you
[C] I don't wanna live without you
[C] I'm only up when you're not down
[C] Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
[C] It's like no matter what I do
[C] Well, you drive me crazy half the time
[C] The other half, I'm only tryin' to
[C] Let you know that what I feel is true
[C] And I'm only me when I'm with you
[V] Just a small-town boy and girl
[V] Livin' in a crazy world
[V] Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
[V] And I don't try to hide my tears
[V] My secrets or my deepest fears
[V] Through it all, nobody gets me like you do
[C] And you know everything about me
[C] You say that you can't live without me
[C] I'm only up when you're not down
[C] Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
[C] It's like no matter what I do
[C] Well, you drive me crazy half the time
[C] The other half, I'm only tryin' to
[C] Let you know that what I feel is true
[C] And I'm only me when I'm with you
[B] When I'm with anybody else
[B] It's so hard to be myself
[B] And only you can tell
[C] That I'm only up when you're not down
[C] Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
[C] It's like no matter what I do
[C] Well, you drive me crazy half the time
[C] The other half, I'm only tryin' to
[C] Let you know that what I feel is true
[C] And I'm only me
[C] Who I wanna be
[C] Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
[I] With you
[I] Uh-huh-huh, yeah

[V] She can't see the way your eyes
[V] Light up when you smile
[V] She'll never notice how you stop and stare
[V] Whenever she walks by
[C] And you can't see me wanting you the way you want her
[C] But you are everything to me
[C] And I just wanna show you
[C] She don't even know you
[C] She's never gonna love you like I want to
[C] And you just see right through me
[C] But if you only knew me
[C] We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
[C] Instead of just invisible
[C] Oh, yeah, oh
[V] There's a fire inside of you
[V] That can't help but shine through
[V] She's never gonna see the light
[V] No matter what you do
[C] And all I think about is how to make you think of me
[C] And everything that we could be
[C] And I just wanna show you
[C] She don't even know you
[C] She's never gonna love you like I want to
[C] And you just see right through me
[C] But if you only knew me
[C] We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
[C] Instead of just invisible
[B] Like shadows in a faded light
[B] Oh, we're invisible
[B] I just wanna open your eyes
[B] And make you realize
[C] I just wanna show you
[C] She don't even know you
[C] Baby, let me love you, let me want you
[C] You just see right through me
[C] But if you only knew me
[C] We could be a beautiful miracle, unbelievable
[C] Instead of just invisible
[C] Oh, yeah
[I] She can't see the way your eyes
[I] Light up when you smile

[C] Why would you wanna break
[C] A perfectly good heart?
[C] Why would you wanna take
[C] Our love and tear it all apart now?
[C] Why would you wanna make
[C] The very first scar?
[C] Why would you wanna break
[C] A perfectly good heart?
[V] Maybe I should've seen the signs
[V] Should've read the writing on the wall
[V] And realized by the distance in your eyes
[V] That I would be the one to fall
[C] No matter what you say
[C] I still can't believe that you would walk away
[C] It don't make sense to me, but
[C] Why would you wanna break
[C] A perfectly good heart?
[C] Why would you wanna take
[C] Our love and tear it all apart now?
[C] Why would you wanna make
[C] The very first scar?
[C] Why would you wanna break
[C] A perfectly good heart?
[B] It's not unbroken anymore (It's not unbroken anymore)
[B] How do I get it back the way it was before?
[C] Why would you wanna break
[C] A perfectly good heart?
[C] Why would you wanna take
[C] Our love and tear it all apart now?
[C] Why would you wanna make
[C] The very first scar?
[C] Why would you wanna break—
[C] (Why) Would you wanna break it?
[C] Why would you wanna break
[C] A perfectly good heart?
[C] Why would you wanna take
[C] Our love and tear it all apart now?
[C] Why would you wanna make
[C] The very first scar?
[C] Why would you wanna break
[C] A perfectly good heart?
[C] Mmm-hmm
